0	Fringe is an American science fiction television series created by J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci. It premiered on the Fox television network on September 9, 2008, and concluded on January 18, 2013, after five seasons comprising 100 episodes. An FBI agent, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv); a genius but dysfunctional scientist, Walter Bishop (John Noble); and his son with a troubled past, Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), are all members of a newly formed Fringe Division in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, and the team uses fringe science to investigate a series of unexplained and often ghastly occurrences which are related to a parallel universe.
1	The series has been described as a hybrid of fantasy, procedural dramas, and serials, influenced by films like Altered States and television shows such as Lost, The X-Files, and The Twilight Zone. The series began as a traditional mystery-of-the-week series and became more serialized in later seasons. Most episodes contain a standalone plot, with several others also exploring the series' overarching mythology.
2	"Critical reception was lukewarm at first but became more favorable after the first season, when the series began to explore its mythology, including parallel universes and alternate timelines. The show, along with cast and crew, was nominated for many major awards. Despite its move to the ""Friday night death slot"" and low ratings, the series developed a cult following. It also spawned two six-part comic book series, an alternate reality game, and three novels."
3	"Fringe follows the casework of the Fringe Division, a Joint Federal Task Force supported primarily by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which includes Agent Olivia Dunham, Dr. Walter Bishop, the archetypal mad scientist, and Peter Bishop, Walter's estranged son and jack-of-all-trades. They are supported by Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick), the force's director, and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole), who assists Walter in laboratory research. The Fringe Division investigates cases relating to fringe science, ranging from transhumanist experiments gone wrong to the prospect of a destructive technological singularity to a possible collision of two parallel universes. The Fringe Division's work often intersects with advanced biotechnology developed by a company called Massive Dynamic, founded by Walter's former partner, Dr. William Bell (Leonard Nimoy), and run by their common friend, Nina Sharp (Blair Brown). The team is also watched silently by a group of bald, pale white men who are called ""Observers""."
4	"Season 1 introduces the Fringe Division as they investigate cases that form ""the Pattern"" geographically centered around Reiden Lake in New York state, many of which are orchestrated by an international network of rogue scientists known as ZFT (Zerstörung durch Fortschritte der Technologie, or in English, Destruction through Advancement of Technology), led by David Robert Jones (Jared Harris), who are preparing for a doomsday event. The ZFT threat appears to end when Peter kills Jones as he attempts travel to a parallel universe. Olivia comes to learn she was a child test subject for Walter years ago (then known as Olive) for a nootropic drug, Cortexiphan, giving her weak psionic abilities. Walter also struggles with adjusting to normal life in Peter's care after living seventeen years in a mental institution while hiding the fact that Peter is from the parallel universe, ""his"" Peter having died as a child.In Season 2, the occurrences are found to be in conjunction with activities of a parallel universe, which is plagued by singularities occurring at weakened points of the fabric between worlds; over there, scientists have developed an amber-like substance that isolates these singularities as well as any innocent people caught in the area on its release. The Fringe team deals with more cases that are leading to a ""great storm"" as the parallel universe appears to be at war with the prime one, engineered by human-machine hybrid shapeshifters from the parallel universe. Walter is forced to tell Peter that he is from the parallel universe, a replacement for his own Peter, who died from a genetic disease. Walter had crossed over on the frozen ice of Reiden Lake in 1985 to administer the cure for the alternate version of Peter, but, after accidentally destroying a dose of the cure upon transport, he instead brought the boy across. On return, they fell through the ice but were saved by the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), who told Walter of the importance of ""the boy"", which Walter took to mean Peter. Walter's crossing is what caused the singularities in the parallel universe, with Reiden Lake at their center. Walter has been looking for a sign of forgiveness in the form of a white tulip.Season 3 presents episodes that alternate between the two universes. ""Walternate"", Walter's doppelgänger in the parallel universe, is the U.S. Secretary of Defense and has set events in motion to assemble the Machine, a doomsday device that reacts only to Peter's biology. He also sent his Olivia, ""Fauxlivia""2, to the prime universe, in Olivia's place, to engage the Fringe Division and assemble the prime universe's version of the device, while he studies Olivia's Cortexiphan-induced powers. By happenstance, Fauxlivia becomes pregnant with Peter's child, Henry, before being outed and extracted to the parallel universe. Walternate orchestrated acceleration of the pregnancy to gain a sample of the baby's blood, which he uses to activate the machine. Peter, with Olivia's help, enters the prime version of the machine, and experiences a vision of the future where the parallel universe has been destroyed and the same fate threatens the prime one, and learns the Machine is really a device created by Walter and his associates from this future, sent back in time purposely to relay this vision of the future to Peter. Recovering in the present, Peter alters his plan and uses the Machine to merge the two rooms, creating a bridge where inhabitants of both universes can solve their dilemma, before time is re-written so September (The Observer) does not save him and is forgotten by both Walter and Olivia.Season 4 begins in an alternate timeline, one in which September had failed to save the alternate version of Peter in 1985, according to the Observers. This creates a butterfly effect influencing the main characters' pasts but otherwise stabilizing both universes due to the creation of the bridge. Peter is pulled into this new timeline due to the actions of the alternate timeline's Fringe team, which includes Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel). Peter initially works to return to his own timeline, fueled by fears that his memories are altering Cortexiphan-dosed Olivia's of this timeline, but after encountering a wounded September, Peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home, and both he and Olivia come to accept the change, rekindling their affair. September also reveals to Peter that the Observers needed to erase Peter's son, Henry, to assure their future will be created, though noting that Peter's future child with Olivia will be important. Meanwhile, in the present, William Bell has instructed David Robert Jones, alive in this timeline, to work with the parallel universe's version of Nina Sharp to synchronize the two universes, aiming to collapse them both and pave the way for a third universe under Bell's control, using Olivia's Cortexiphan powers to enable the collapse. The Fringe division is forced to close the dimensional bridge, but this fails to stop Bell's plan. Walter is left with one choice, to shoot and kill Olivia, her death disrupting the process and saving the world. Olivia's ""death"" is only temporary, as the Cortexiphan in her body is consumed to repair the bullet wound, leaving her alive and healthy but lacking her psionic abilities. As Olivia and Peter begin their lives together, September appears to Walter and warns that the Observers ""are coming"".The fifth and final season begins in 2036, following from the flash-forward fourth-season episode ""Letters of Transit"". As September warned, Observers, bald white males from the far future, having ruined Earth for themselves, time-traveled to 2015 and instituted ""The Purge"", wiped out much of humanity, subjected the survivors to their control, and began modifying the planet's environment to be more suitable for themselves. The Fringe team was able to seal themselves in amber to avoid capture shortly after the Purge, and are reunited through Henrietta (""Etta"") (Georgina Haig), Peter and Olivia's now adult daughter who disappeared shortly after the Observer arrival in 2015. Walter reveals he and September developed a plan to defeat the Observers, revealed through a series of pre-recorded videotapes ambered in the lab. The tapes lead to several components of a device, including a young Observer child, named Michael (Spencer List in Season 1 and Rowan Longworth in Season 5), but further allude to a man named Donald that had helped Walter prepare the plan. Etta is killed during these events, driving Olivia and Peter to complete the plan for her sake. Through Michael, they discover Donald is September, having been stripped of his Observer powers for helping the Fringe team, and that Michael is his genetic son, having been purposely grown as an anomaly in the far future. September explains the plan is to send Michael to the year 2167, where human genetic experiments to sacrifice emotion for intelligence would be started and leading to the creation of the Observers; by showing them Michael, who possesses both emotion and intelligence, the experiments would be stopped and the Observers never created. September is prepared to take Michael to the future as the plan is set in motion, but he is shot and killed at the last moment; Walter, already made aware that he will have to make a sacrifice, takes Michael through to the future to assure the plan's completion. As predicted, time is reset from the invasion onwards in 2015; the Observers never invade, and Peter, Olivia, and Etta, live their lives peacefully—though Peter receives one final letter from his father: a drawing of a white tulip."
5	"Much of the story arc for Fringe involves an alternate universe that mostly mirrors the prime universe, but with numerous historical idiosyncrasies.  A significant example element used is the effect of the September 11 attacks; though this event also occurred in the alternate universe, the World Trade Center was untouched by the attacks, leaving the buildings as predominant landmarks in the alternate world's skyline of ""Manhatan"". The South Tower was used as the office of William Bell in several episodes.The producers were strongly interested in ""world-building,"" and the alternate universe allowed them to create a very similar world with a large amount of detail to fill in the texture of the world. An alternate universe also allowed them to show ""how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line,"" according to co-director Jeff Pinkner. However, the producers also realized the concept of the alternate universe could be confusing to viewers. To avoid this, elements of the world were introduced in small pieces over the course of the first two seasons before the larger revelation in the second-season finale and the third season. J. H. Wyman stated that he would often pass the story ideas for the alternate universe by his father to see if it made sense, and would rework the script if his father found it confusing. Such world building also gave them a risky opportunity to create stories that focused solely on characters from the alternate universe with nearly no ties to the main characters; as stated by Wyman, they would be able to ""make two shows about one show,"" a concept that the network executives embraced."
6	"Prior to commercial breaks, a brief image of a glyph is shown. Abrams revealed in an interview that the glyphs had a hidden meaning. ""It's something that we're doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show."" Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their backs appeared in promos for the show and have significance within the context of the series, saying ""it's part of the code of the show."" The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word ""observer"". Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from ""Johari Window"", the seahorse strain of DNA from ""The Bishop Revival""). In ""Jacksonville"", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia."
7	"The show's standard opening sequence interplays images of the glyph symbols alongside words representing fringe science topics, such as ""teleportation"" and ""dark matter."" Within the third season, with episodes that took place primarily in the parallel universe, a new set of titles was used, following a similar format, though tinted red instead of blue and using alternate fringe science concepts like ""hypnosis"" and ""neuroscience"". The difference in color has led some fans to call the prime universe the Blue one in contrast to the parallel Red one. In the third-season episode ""Entrada"", the titles used a mix of both the blue- and red-tinted versions, given that the episode took place equally in each universe. In the two flashback episodes, ""Peter"" and ""Subject 13,"" a variation on the sequence, with retro graphics akin to 1980s technology and phrases like ""personal computing"" and ""genetic engineering"" was used. For the dystopian future third-season episode ""The Day We Died,"" a black-toned theme with more dire phrases like ""hope"" and ""water"" was used. The fourth-season premiere, ""Neither Here Nor There"", introduced an amber-toned title sequence, with additional new terms, that is used for nearly all fourth-season episodes. The fourth-season episode ""Letters of Transit,"" which returned to the future dystopian universe, and the subsequent fifth-season episodes, feature a cold-toned title sequence with phrases such as ""joy,"" ""private thought,"" ""free will,"" and ""freedom,"" ideas which have been lost in this future. There is one frame in the opening sequence in which the words ""Observers are here"" flash very quickly, and the opening sequence must be paused to see them."

35	"Co-created by J. J. Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, Fringe was produced by Bad Robot in association with Warner Bros. Television, as part of a commitment that Abrams previously made with the studio. At the time, Abrams was working with Orci and Kurtzman on the Star Trek film, and met at one of the Comic-Cons during Star Trek's production to brainstorm ideas for the show. Abrams later brought Bryan Burk, a producer on several of his films, to help with developing the series.Abrams's inspiration for Fringe came from a range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the film Altered States, films by David Cronenberg, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. Orci stated that Fringe is a ""new kind of storytelling"", combining procedural shows such as Law & Order, and an ""extremely serialized and very culty"" series like Lost. The procedural aspect was chosen because, at the time of its premiere, six of the ten top shows were procedural in nature; Orci stated that ""you have to be a fool not to go study what it is that they're doing"". Abrams had originally considered naming the series The Lab, as they had envisioned Walter's laboratory to be ""the epicenter of the conversation"", and where ""anything is possible"".Though the team saw this as a way of presenting ""mystery of the week""-type episodes, they wanted to focus more on how these stories were told in unpredictable ways rather than the actual mystery, recognizing that most of their target audience has seen such mysteries before through previous shows and films. Instead, they wanted their storytelling to be original and unexpected, and, as claimed by Kurtzman, one of the most challenging aspects of developing the individual episodes. Serialization of the show was important to tell their overall story with larger plot elements, but Abrams recognized the difficulties that his earlier serialized shows, such as Lost and Alias, had in attracting and maintaining viewers that had not seen these shows from the start or who missed episodes sporadically. For Fringe, Abrams instead sought to create, as stated by David Itzkoff of the New York Times, ""a show that suggested complexity but was comprehensible in any given episode"". The writers aimed to balance a line between stand-alone episodes, a factor requested by Fox, and a heavily serialized show; they balanced these by moving the serialization aspect to the growth and development of their characters. This gave them the ability to write self-contained episodes that still contained elements related to the overall mythos. However, as production continued, the creative staff found the show itself took on a more serialized nature and opted towards this approach in later seasons while still balancing self-contained episodes.One method was by introducing overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as ""The Pattern"" in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot over the course of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias.  A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production.  Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create ""clearly defined goalposts"" (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that ""There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe, if shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air."" Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from ""how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell"". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that ""We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story.""As part of the larger story, the writers have placed elements in earlier episodes that are referenced in episodes seasons later. For example, in the first-season episode ""The Ghost Network"", the Fringe team encounters an amber-like substance, which is later shown to be a critical means to combat the breakdown of the parallel universe and eventually for the same in the prime universe with the third-season episode ""6B"". Pinkner compared this aspect to ""planting seeds"", some which they know how they plan to use later in the show's story, while others they can find ways of incorporating into these later episodes.He further attributed these elements as part of the ""world building"" to flesh out the show beyond episodic content. The producers have stated that when the show's mythology is introduced, it is not simply there to tie episodes together, but ""to provide answers that generate consequences"".Certain elements of the show's mythology were established from the start. The parallel universe was always part of the original concept, though aspects of when and how to introduce it were tackled as the show proceeded. The idea of Peter being from the parallel universe came early into the show's production, but this came to lead the team to jokingly refer to Peter as their ""hatch"", one of the early mysteries in Lost, as with the hatch in Lost, they initially had no idea how to introduce this within the show. FOX's Reilly was also initially concerned about the parallel universe aspect, but as the show progressed into the first season and found its groove, the concept was readily accepted. The most poignant introduction of the parallel universe was in the conclusion of the first-season finale, ""There's More Than One of Everything"", where they showed the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were still standing in the parallel universe, a concept introduced by writer Andrew Kreisberg as an iconic image to leave viewers with; Jackson stated, ""I don't know that we've ever had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger.""Other mythos elements were devised as the series progressed. The writers had originally envisioned only spending small portions of episodes within the parallel universe, but as they wrote these episodes within Season 3, they brought out the idea of setting entire episodes within the parallel universe. This necessitated the development of the alternate versions of the main characters, which Pinkner considered ""a great playground just for imagination"". The actors themselves found this concept exciting, as it allowed them to play different characters but with the same background and considered it a creative challenge. Similarly, having Peter erased from the timeline as part of the finale for Season 3 was an idea that grew over the course of that season. The writers were aware this would be a risky move but felt the idea was very appropriate for Fringe, and opted to write towards this after considering all the consequences. Pinkner noted that this gave them an opportunity to ""reset the character relationships"" and determine the key aspects that would remain without Peter, as well as ""making the audience uncomfortable at times"". The cast was not initially sold with the idea, but came around as the fourth season progressed."
36	"After developing the core concepts of the show, Abrams began to seek studios to develop the show; Abrams' past successes led to Warner Bros. Television and the Fox Television Network to quickly jump on board the project. Peter Roth, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Television, had been actively seeking to bring any Abrams' project to his studio, and heard Abrams' pitch for Fringe at a dinner meeting in August 2007. Similarly, Kevin Reilly, the entertainment chairman at Fox, knew that it was critical for him to bring the next Abrams' project to his network, and worked with Roth to assure this would happen.Jeff Pinkner was selected to act as the head showrunner and executive producer. Abrams noted that he trusts Pinkner after working together with him on Alias and Lost. Pinkner became interested in the show during a visit to the set of Star Trek, during which Abrams was discussing the concept of Fringe with Orci and Kurtzman, knowing that they would not be involved in the direct production of the work. Abrams pitched the idea to Pinkner, who was intrigued by the importance of characters in a science fiction drama. In season two, J.H. Wyman was brought on as executive producer and showrunner with Pinkner. Wyman had been a science fiction enthusiast but had worried that he had not written anything in that genre but after learning about the concept of the show, felt his role as an executive producer was ""a match made in heaven"".Michael Giacchino, Abrams' frequent collaborator, composed the music for the pilot of Fringe, before handing over duties to his assistants Chad Seiter and Chris Tilton; Tilton took over scoring duties from Season 2 onward. While Giacchino retains an on-screen credit, Abrams himself wrote the series theme music.The two-hour pilot episode, filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, cost a total of $10 million to create. A basement of an old church was used for Walter's lab set in the pilot, and this set was replicated at other film sites in New York and Vancouver when the show moved. The lab set was designed by Carol Spier, the production designer for several of Cronenberg's films. John Noble called his character's lab ""the heart and soul of Fringe"", so consequently, ""That has to remain constant."" A cow used in the pilot episode had to be recast when production of Season 1 was moved to New York, due to livestock restrictions preventing it from being brought from Canada to the United States. Other locations used in the first season included other universities to stage for the Harvard University campus, where Walter's lab is located. These included Pratt Institute and Yale University, including its Old Campus (particularly Phelps Hall and Durfee Hall), Branford College, and the exterior of Yale Law School, University of Toronto's University College, Brooklyn College."
37	On February 21, 2009, it was reported that in the event that Fringe would be renewed for a second season, the show would move production to Vancouver from New York City as a cost-cutting measure. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner explained:
38	We want to stay in New York, New York has been incredibly good to us. It feels like we're being kicked out of the city. I know we're not, but they're making it impossible for us to afford doing the show ... Our New York crew is spectacular, they've worked their [butts] off to make the show look great. But it looks like New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York. So it looks like, out of necessity, we'll have to leave New York, which is not anything we are welcoming.
39	As plans were being made to move the production to Canada, the New York state legislature passed continuation of the film and tax credits, as planned.  Upon productions moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for season 2, the University of British Columbia now stands in for Harvard. The area around New Westminster often serves as filming locations for Fringe stories that take place in the parallel universe.Prior to the start of production for the fifth season, Pinkner announced that he was leaving the production of the show to pursue other projects; Wyman would remain as the sole showrunner for the show.
40	"The show's main characters, Olivia, Peter, and Walter, were at the core of the concept for Fringe. The creators recognized early that ""the idea that telling a father-son story and a relationship story was a really compelling one and a very accessible one"", according to Kurtzman. They were able to provide the characters with backstories that, like with other long-term plot elements, could be alluded to over several episodes and seasons.The characters would also contrast with the typical procedural genre show; rather than having clearly defined roles episode to episode, they instead ""have an emotional memory and an emotional investment"", as stated by Orci. This also allowed for, as necessary, characters to be removed or introduced to the show and have a larger impact on the other characters.The first actors cast were Kirk Acevedo and Mark Valley, who portrayed FBI agents Charlie Francis and John Scott, respectively. John Noble and Lance Reddick, who play Dr. Walter Bishop and Homeland Security agent Phillip Broyles, joined the cast later on. Casting of Anna Torv, Blair Brown, and Jasika Nicole, who play Olivia Dunham, Massive Dynamic employee Nina Sharp, and Astrid Farnsworth, a federal agent and assistant to Olivia Dunham, respectively, followed; while Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop, was the last main character to be cast. Jackson auditioned for James T. Kirk in Abrams' Star Trek and believed this is what impressed the producer to cast him in his television project, though Abrams later clarified that it was recalling his previous experience with working with Jackson on his television series Felicity. For the principal and recurring actors, they were all intrigued by the script for the pilot, comparing it to a two-hour-long movie, as well as Abrams' reputation.On April 8, 2009, it was announced that Leonard Nimoy would appear as Walter Bishop's former lab partner, Dr. William Bell, in the first season's finale, which explores the existence of an ominous parallel universe. This choice led one reviewer to question if Fringe's plot might be a homage to the Star Trek episode ""Mirror, Mirror"", which explored the concept of an alternate reality referred to as a ""mirror universe"", and an evil version of Spock distinguished by a goatee. Nimoy returned as Dr. Bell for an extended arc, and according to Orci, Bell is ""the beginning of the answers to even bigger questions."" Nimoy reprised his role in the second-season finale, where his character and Walter met for a ""showdown"". Nimoy's character is apparently dead after the season finale, having used himself to help Walter, Peter and the Alternate Olivia back to the prime universe. As he had retired from acting, it was thought unlikely that his character would return.  In February 2011 however, he announced his definite plan to return to Fringe and reprise his role as William Bell. He returned to voice the character in the animated segments of the third-season episode ""Lysergic Acid Diethylamide"", and appeared as a computer-generated character in the fourth-season episode ""Letters of Transit"". In the two-part finale of the fourth season, Nimoy returned to play the ultimate antagonist of the alternate timeline story arc."
41	"Early reception through the first season was generally lukewarm, with many noting its ""lackluster"" start and the ""dullness"" of the characters. However, changes in the approach and storytelling of the show in the second and subsequent seasons led to more positive critical reception and made it a media favorite. As a whole, the series was well received by the critics and has developed a cult following."
42	"The pilot episode was watched by 9.13 million viewers, garnering 3.2/9 Nielsen ratings among adults 18–49, with ratings improving over the course of the episode. Ratings improved greatly for the second episode, ""The Same Old Story"" which 13.27 million people watched, making it the fifth most watched show of the week. As of October 2008, the show had achieved the first place in the 18–49 demographic among new shows. Barry Garron at The Hollywood Reporter found it promising and ""reminiscent of battle-of-the-sexes charm."" Robert Bianco, of USA Today, said, ""What Abrams brings to Fringe is a director's eye for plot and pace, a fan's love of sci-fi excitement, and a story-teller's gift for investing absurd events with real emotions and relatable characters."" Travis Fickett of IGN gave it 7.6 out of 10, calling it ""a lackluster pilot that promises to be a pretty good series"". While Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle remarked that it was ""boundlessly ambitious"", Chicago Sun-Times's Misha Davenport called it an ""update of The X-Files with the addition of terrorism and the office of Homeland Security"". In a 2016 retrospective of the series, A.V. Club writer Joshua Alston noted that the similarities to The X-Files, including the ""monster of the week"" approach and tepid romance between two of the series' lead characters, as well as the relatively recent release of The X-Files: I Want to Believe, had turned audiences off the show since ""it was retreading what The X-Files had already done.""In its 2008 Year in Review, Television Without Pity declared Fringe one of the year's biggest TV disappointments, commenting that the show is ""entertaining"" and ""the cast is largely strong"" but the character development is insufficient, and describing main character Olivia Dunham as ""wooden and distant.""  Meanwhile, in other articles recounting the best and worst of 2008, The New York Times stated that Fringe ""is the best of a rash of new series that toy with the paranormal"". The author goes on to praise the cast saying that ""Much credit belongs to Anna Torv who stars as an F.B.I. agent investigating bizarre murders that all appear to be linked to a powerful and mysterious multinational corporation"", and ""Ms. Torv is backed up ably by John Noble as a crazy but brilliant fringe scientist and his level-headed but skeptical son, played by Joshua Jackson""."
43	"Seasons of Fringe after the first season were seen as vast improvements on the first. Entertainment Weekly stated, ""The best new show of the year took a few weeks to grow on me, but now it's a full-blown addiction."" The Los Angeles Times called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, ""the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi.""Chicago Tribune stated that some episodes are ""distressingly predictable and formulaic"" but adds that there have also been some excellent episodes. The New York Times named Fringe one of the top 10 television shows in 2010, while Television Without Pity, previously dismissive of the show, listed it amongst their 2010 ""Most Memorable TV Moments"", stating ""there were so many great Fringe moments this year"" and ""we were treated to some of the best sci-fi on television this past fall"".The A.V. Club named Fringe the 15th best show of 2010, stated that the episode ""Peter"" gave ""the series' overarching storyline a devastating emotional core"", making the series a ""rare blend of inventive ideas, wild ambition, and unexpected soulfulness"". IGN named Fringe the 18th best science fiction show of all time in a 2011 listing, stating that since the middle of the first season, ""it's been nothing but a series of satisfyingly jaw-dropping 'holy eff!' moments layered with wonderful, nuanced performances from Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson and John Noble"".In 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at #17 in the ""25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years"", saying, ""Fringe was conceived as a mass-appeal genre procedural, with a background mythology that wouldn't detract from monster-of-the-week episodes. ... But the mythology overtook the monsters following the revelation of a parallel universe. By its third season, Fringe was overpopulated by multiple versions of every character. Unfortunately, that increasing narrative complexity has steadily pigeonholed it as a niche show.""In 2015, Bustle declared ""White Tulip"" as ""one of the greatest hours in television history"". He wrote, ""'White Tulip' is an hour of television that shouldn't work, that technically doesn't even exist ... but thank god it does, because it's one of the most powerful episodes ever created — and it showcases why Fringe is one of the most criminally underrated series of our time."""
44	"Fringe premiered in the 2008 United States television season at a regular timeslot of 9:00 p.m. Eastern on Tuesdays.  During Season 1, Fringe was part of a Fox initiative known as ""Remote-Free TV"". Episodes of Fringe were longer than standard dramas on current network television. The show ran with half the commercials, adding about six minutes to the show's runtime. When the show went to a commercial, a short bumper aired informing the viewer of roughly how much time commercials would consume before the program resumed. The pilot episode was leaked via BitTorrent, three months before the series premiere; similar to leaked fellow Fox series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The series was renewed for a second season on May 4, 2009, and moved to 9:00 p.m. on Thursday.It was renewed for a third season on March 6, 2010. As part of a reorganization of its 2010 midseason line up to capture more market for American Idol, the Fox network shifted Fringe to 9:00 p.m. on Fridays.  This timeslot, commonly considered the ""Friday night death slot"" for several previous Fox shows due to cancellation shortly following the move to that slot, left critics considering the show's fate.  While The X-Files originally premiered during this slot and would continue to be a highly successful series, critics were unsure if Fringe could duplicate this performance.  In this slot, the show competed with Supernatural, a series that attracts similar types of viewers. Fox's Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, in response to these concerns, stated that 45% of Fringe's viewership is from time shifting recording through digital video receivers, and does not expect the viewership numbers to change significantly with the change to Friday. Reilly further postulated that ""If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us"". Further promoted by the critical reaction to the rescheduling, the Fox network created a self-deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging the reputation of the time slot, including quotes from other media outlets concerned about the move, but asserted that the move would ""re-animate"" the show. The network also created a music video, set to ""Echoes"" by the band Klaxons as a means of summarizing the third season to date prior to the first Friday broadcast. Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop on the show, cautioned that time-shifted viewership may not be enough to save the show: ""It's not that not enough people are watching Fringe, it's that not enough people are watching Fringe during the hour that it's on the air, which is key for the network.""Producers Pinkner and Wyman also were excited about the move to Fridays, considering the slot as ""open territory that can be conquered"" and that they ""can actually deliver like The X-Files did"". Series creator Abrams was less optimistic of the move to Friday nights, aware that the show's likelihood to be renewed for a fourth season would be highly dependent on the number of niche viewers that continue to watch the show. Abrams did affirm that moving to Friday nights allows them to take more creative freedoms to maintain viewership in the new timeslot, but feels that if the show was not renewed for another season, they would be ""hard pressed"" to resolve the story by the end of the third season.The show's first episode at the Friday 9:00 p.m. timeslot (""The Firefly"") scored a 1.9 in the key 18–49 demographic which was an increase of 12% over its last Thursday-aired episode (""Marionette"") which scored a 1.7, and maintained similar numbers in the second week for ""Reciprocity"". Though viewership slipped in further weeks, the show was renewed for a fourth season in March 2011. The move was unexpected based on these ratings, given the past performance of shows with similar viewership numbers in the Friday night slot, but several critics attribute it to the strong fanbase that the show has garnered, which contributes in part to consistently higher time-shifted viewership. Fox's Reilly stated that:"
45	Fringe has truly hit a creative stride and has distinguished itself as one of television's most original programs. The series' ingenious producers, amazingly talented cast and crew, as well as some of the most passionate and loyal fans on the planet, made this fourth-season pickup possible. When we moved the show to Fridays, we asked the fans to follow and they did. We're thrilled to bring it back for another full season and keep it part of the Fox family.
46	"Reilly further added that the renewal was also prompted by the high risk of trying to replace Fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they ""have a far better shot of sticking with a show that has an audience that [they] think [they] can grow"". Prior to the onset of the fourth season, Reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in Fringe's viewership within that season: ""It's a pretty complex show. If Fringe can do exactly what Fringe did last year, we're going to be very happy. They're right in the pocket creatively once again."" Wyman stated in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Fox network had been ""supportive throughout this process"", and though the show's viewership ""wasn't exactly what they would've hoped for"", aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take the show forward for another season. Pinkner commented that ""there were no creative conditions"" on the show's renewal, nor any cuts in the show's budget, though was unsure if the show will be moved to a different time slot. Noble, at the 2011 Comic-Con Fringe panel, reiterated that the fans were responsible for the livelihood of the show, stated, ""Seriously, without your efforts, your rabid support, we wouldn't be here right now. You are the best fans that ever existed"". The fourth season premiered on September 23, 2011.Before the renewal of the fifth season, Abrams stated some skepticism for a renewal opportunity, but hoped that if it was cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, ""the next year would be the great ending for the show"". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show is one of the top shows in the Friday night slot, ""it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show."" Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, ""That's a Peter Roth issue"" (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, ""We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue"". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated ""We want to take care of the fans. We want them to see where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it.""The show was officially renewed for a fifth and final season for the 2012–2013 television season, consisting of a shortened set of 13 episodes, on April 26, 2012, with its premiere on September 28, 2012. Reilly, in announcing the renewal, stated that ""Fringe is a remarkably creative series that has set the bar as one of television's most imaginative dramas. Bringing it back for a final 13 allows us to provide the climactic conclusion that its passionate and loyal fans deserve"". The writing team crafted an idea for a cohesive story-driven set of thirteen episodes as a means to complete the series, and to ""honor the audience that had served us so well was to say a proper farewell"", according to Roth. Noble called it ""the season for the fans"", with the story revisiting many of the elements from the show's past."

58	The pilot episode of the Fringe television series premiered on the Fox network on September 9, 2008. The pilot to season 1 was written by the creators of the series—J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci—and directed by Alex Graves. The episode introduces the most central character, Olivia Dunham, portrayed by Anna Torv, an FBI special agent forced into the world of applied fringe science after a number of freak incidents. Dr. Walter Bishop, a scientist formerly incarcerated in a mental institution for over seventeen years, is portrayed by John Noble, while Joshua Jackson plays his son, Peter, who is hired by Olivia to assist with Walter and his work.
59	Although the pilot was set in and around Boston, Massachusetts, filming occurred in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The episode cost $10 million to produce, making it one of the most expensive pilots in television history. The pilot was leaked online three months prior to its broadcast on television, leading to speculation that it was leaked deliberately to increase interest in the program. However, this was denied by executive producer Bryan Burk. The episode was generally well received by critics, and was watched by 9.13 million American viewers on its premiere.
60	A man on an international flight injects himself with an insulin pen, which releases a biological agent that quickly kills everyone aboard by causing their flesh to crystallize. The airplane's autopilot system lands the plane at Boston's Logan Airport, where various federal agencies create a task force to investigate what occurred during the flight. F.B.I. Special Agent Olivia Dunham and her partner, Agent Scott (Mark Valley), are together in bed at a motel, where Scott says that he loves her. Dunham receives a call from her boss Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), who tells her to head to the airport. Dunham is added to the interagency task force headed by Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick).
61	"Following a tip, Dunham and Scott are sent to a storage facility where they uncover a biochemical laboratory, which explodes when detonated by a suspect they are chasing. Scott is affected by the chemicals released in the explosion, and is placed into an artificial coma to slow the progression of the chemical reaction. While investigating a possible cure to Scott's condition, Dunham blackmails Peter Bishop to gain access to his father Dr. Walter Bishop, whose top-secret work at Harvard in ""fringe science"" resulted in him being sent to a mental institution. Dunham manages to release Walter from the institution; however, he becomes enraged when he discovers his laboratory in Harvard has been shut down. Broyles reopens the laboratory, where Dunham transfers Scott's body. To identify the man from the storage facility, Walter synchronizes Dunham's brainwaves with the comatose Scott's so that she can read his mind. Walter claims that syncing brainwaves, and even reanimating the dead, can be accomplished up to six hours after death. With the help of Dunham's assistant, federal agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole), the experiment succeeds. Dunham identifies the man in Scott's memory, Morgan Steig, as a passenger on the plane. The team learns Steig's twin brother, Richard Steig, was an employee of Massive Dynamic, a company founded by William Bell, Walter's old lab partner."
62	"Dunham goes to Massive Dynamic headquarters and meets with executive director Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who agrees to give her all the information on Steig. The suspect is arrested and initially refuses to provide a list of the ingredients present in the toxin, but Peter's threat of exposing him to the chemicals causes him to reveal the ingredients. The information provides a cure for Scott. The suspect reveals that he did not sell his chemicals, but was forced into what he did by someone from Dunham's office. The suspect leads Dunham to a buried tape recording of his phone conversations about the chemicals and the attack, where Dunham realizes that Scott was involved with the attack from the beginning. While she races back to the hospital, Scott awakens and kills the suspect. He is chased by Dunham, but crashes his car and is mortally wounded. Before he dies, Scott asks Dunham why Broyles would send her to investigate the storage units in the first place. Dunham convinces the Bishops to stay and help her with her new work, which Broyles describes as a task force to investigate events related to ""the pattern"". Elsewhere, Scott's dead body is brought to a Massive Dynamic high-tech lab, where Sharp orders that Scott be interrogated, since he has only been dead for five hours."
63	"Co-creator J. J. Abrams' inspiration for Fringe came from a range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the Ken Russell film Altered States, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not ""evident but alluded to in the pilot."" The team spent a lot of time thinking about the ""trifecta of characters"" that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, ""you don't necessarily have to know anything about science, because everyone has a parent and everyone has issues with a parent. And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character."" Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an ""extremely serialized and very culty"" series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.The first actors cast in the pilot were Kirk Acevedo and Mark Valley in mid January 2008. John Noble and Lance Reddick were next to be cast, although it was incorrectly believed that Tomas Arana had been cast in Reddick's role. This was followed by the casting of Anna Torv, Blair Brown and Jasika Nicole. Abrams said that Torv was cast because she was a combination of ""sophistication, great talent, amazing looks and a complexity that is the key to the character being an interesting central character."" Kurtzman felt that she was someone ""you want to spend time with"", which was critical to a series about science. Joshua Jackson was the last series regular to be cast. Jackson auditioned for the role of James T. Kirk in Abrams' Star Trek and believed this is what impressed the producer to cast him in his television project. According to Abrams, Jackson's casting was ""very last minute.""While the pilot was set in and around Boston, production was set in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The episode cost $10 million to produce, making it one of the most expensive pilots in television history. Following the pilot's filming, production for the series moved to New York. The producers were forced to hire a new cow for the remainder of the season because they were not allowed to transport the original cow from Canada to New York. Production team members noted that they were prepared to paint new cows if viewers noted the differences in spots.Three months prior to its broadcast, an incomplete version of the pilot was released through BitTorrent clients, fueling speculation that it was leaked deliberately to increase interest in the program. Executive producer Burk denied the claims, saying that ""we hate putting anything out there until it's done, and that's really the reason why you guys didn't get any advance copies."" Abrams said that while the production crew ""freaked out"" about the leak, he was pleased that the ""response has been much more positive than not, especially for something that wasn't completed yet."" The broadcast version of the pilot had new scenes added while other scenes were removed; Abrams also said that there was ""tightening and moving some moments here and there"", and the ending was entirely different. Burk also stated that the composer, Michael Giacchino, had not finished his score at the time of the leak, and the most of the featured music was temp music. A variation of a piece of Giacchino's music called ""Hollywood and Vines"" used in the pilot was originally featured on Lost, as it was created for that show, also created by Abrams."
64	"""Pilot"" was watched by 9.13 million American viewers, with ratings improving over the course of the episode. The episode garnered a 3.2/9 Nielsen ratings in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic, and was the 12th most watched series of the week. The 3.2 refers to 3.2% of all people of ages 18–49 years old in the U.S., and the 9 refers to 9% of all people of ages 18–49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S. The pilot officially premiered at the 2008 Television Critics Association tour, where it received mixed to positive reviews from critics."
65	"Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a weighted average based on the impressions of a select 25 critical reviews—of 67, signifying generally favorable reviews. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter found it promising because ""it is reminiscent of better-of-the-sexes charm."" USA Today's Robert Bianco said, ""what Abrams brings to Fringe is a director's eye for plot and pace, a fan's love of sci-fi excitement, and a story-teller's gift for investing absurd events with real emotions and relatable characters."" Travis Fickett of IGN gave the pilot 7.6 out of 10, calling it ""a lackluster pilot that promises to be a pretty good series."" Tim Goodman of San Francisco Chronicle remarked that despite ""some flaws in it—mostly from a clash of tones—it still overdelivers on creativity, creepiness, fine acting and burgeoning character development."" Chicago Sun-Times' Misha Davenport called it an ""update of The X-Files with the addition of terrorism and the office of Homeland Security.John Doyle of The Globe and Mail called the pilot ""splendidly made."" However, Doyle considered the instance of Torv stripping to a bikini ""indulgent"", and questioned the wisdom of making ""her body an object of scrutiny"" in the first episode. Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe wrote that ""after the electrifying start, Fringe unfolds as an uneven, unwieldy piece of work that provides very few chills and thrills."" LA Weekly's Robert Abele found Fringe is ""a smorgasbord of a show, but one a little too synthetically engineered to allow you the chance to discover what it is."" John Leonard of New York was skeptical of the premise and storyline, but found Torv ""wonderfully played"" her character. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com felt the plot was too over-the-top, and described Abrams as ""the ultimate boyish idiot-savant imaginator... He can't exercise a little self-restraint.""The pilot episode was negatively received by the conservative ""family values"" advocacy group Parents Television Council, who named the show the worst of the week and denounced the ""excessive violence and gore."""

69	"""The Same Old Story"" is the second episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode was written by executive producer Jeff Pinkner and co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci.  When developing the series, they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural. ""The Same Old Story"" was the first regular episode of Fringe, and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series. It was directed by Paul A. Edwards."
70	After a newborn baby rapidly ages into an 80-year-old man, Fringe division agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) investigate. They tie the case to the murders of young women, who have all had their pituitary glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in progeria, is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome.
71	"""The Same Old Story"" first aired in the United States on September 16, 2008 on Fox. An estimated 13.272 million viewers watched the episode, a 45 percent increase from the series premiere. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics – reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances."
72	"A prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital, dangerously in labor. She dies as the doctors perform a caesarean section, but the child ages rapidly in minutes, soon dead having aged to the likes of a 90-year-old man. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), new members of the Fringe division, are called to investigate by division head Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick), believing the case to be part of ""The Pattern"", a string of mysterious incidents. The woman is identified as having recently left a local motel, and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner John Scott were not able to solve. Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would paralyze his victims, young women, then make an incision along their face to extract a piece of brain material, killing the victim in the process. Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth, her child having a preternatural form of accelerated aging disease. Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field, and remembers where he stashed his car that contains the related files. Once they are retrieved, Olivia makes a connection to the pituitary gland which controls growth in humans, and informs Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) to monitor recent cases where the victims' pituitary gland has been removed."
73	Olivia and Peter turn to an expert in progeria, Dr. Penrose (Mark Blum), to try to learn more about rapid aging, but Dr. Penrose cannot help them further, though Peter suspects he is hiding something. Unseen by the Fringe division, Dr. Penrose visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer, Christopher (Derek Cecil), his son, who suffers from rapid aging syndrome. Penrose warns Christopher to be careful and that they only need one more woman to complete the process.  By this time, Charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion as Olivia's serial murderer. At Walter's lab, they identify the pituitary gland has been removed. They rationalize the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process.  Walter hypothesizes they can discover the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman's optical nerves induced by the paralyzing sedative. Borrowing an electronic pulse camera from Massive Dynamic, they discover the image of a suspension bridge near Stoughton and identify the likely location from which it was viewed—the same warehouse that Dr. Penrose visited. The FBI converge on the building, and Olivia and Peter find Penrose about to cut into another victim. Olivia chases off after Christopher, who eventually succumbs to his rapid aging and dies, while Peter, after nicking Penrose with a bullet, confers with Walter to apply a makeshift defibrillator to bring the victim back to life.
74	As they wrap up the case, Olivia, Peter, and Walter complete forms to finalize their position in the Fringe division. When Peter is out of earshot, Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter's childhood are void of any details.
75	"Co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co-creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration. Kurztman explained, ""While we make sure that our episodes are self-contained – have a beginning, a middle, and an end – the character stories can be serialized. They don't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show."" ""The Same Old Story"" was Fringe's first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured.The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they ""drilled out the eyeball and sculpt[ed] it open and [went] through a series of molds."" Stanley stated that ""it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out."" The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a ""photon gun""; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used ""a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location,"" which they then used to ""take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab.""""The Same Old Story"" featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher Penrose and Mark Blum as his father, Dr. Claus Penrose. Other guest actors included Betty Gilpin as Loraine ""Amber"" Daisy Alcott, Bernie McInerney as old Christopher Penrose, Carmen Goodine as Amy, Ty Jones as a doctor, and Karin Agstam as John Scott's sister."
76	"""The Same Old Story"" was watched by 13.272 million viewers in the United States, a 45 percent increase of four million from the pilot. Fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over five years. Its high-rated lead-in, House, helped boost Fringe's ratings for the night, as 93 percent of House's total audience and 95 percent of 18- to 49-year-olds stayed to watch Fringe.  Fringe was also the highest rated program for male 18- to 54-year-olds that evening."
77	"""The Same Old Story"" received mixed reviews from television critics. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw thought the episode seemed ""all over the place"", and wasn't sure what to think. She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl's eye in order to identity her killer, and the cliffhanger at the very end, when Walter states ""If you've read my file, then you know the truth about Peter's medical history"". Travis Fickett of IGN thought it was better than the pilot; though it was ""laden with lots of clunky exposition and clichéd dialogue,"" Fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show. Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe has the potential to be a ""great show"", and he also praised the production level as ""top notch"", and Torv's performance as ""very good"" as she ""brings a unique presence to the show"". The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C+, while Television Without Pity graded it with a B."
78	"Josh Jackson of Paste Magazine disliked the ""deus ex machina"" aspects that ""neatly solved the puzzles of the first two episodes"", and also criticized perceived ""plot contrivances"" like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim. Despite these flaws, Jackson said he would tune in next week because he would ""rather have a show err on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable, and I'm interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve"". Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked ""The Same Old Story"" better than the pilot because she thought that it ""had really cool special effects, awesome Walter-isms, and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter"", and ""we also got to delve more into the connections between Walter, Nina Sharp, Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was institutionalized"".A UGO Networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes, but ""after sitting down to watch Fringe's second episode, ""The Same Old Story"", my concerns have vanished. Fringe's second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of Fringe's eleven-herbs and spices. In fact, the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X-Files is even better defined in the first weekly-episode. I'd struggled to find the word to describe it, and the winner is 'condensed'. ""The Same Old Story"" has all of the sense of mystery, discovery, and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller, more combustible space."" Another UGO writer, Alex Zalben, later compared ""The Same Old Story"" to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode ""Død Kalm"". Zalben concluded that ""Fringe wins this one, just for having a slightly less stupid explanation."""

81	"""The Ghost Network"" is the third episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode was written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman and supervising producer J. R. Orci, and was directed by Frederick E. O. Toye. The episode follows the Fringe team's investigation into a bus that was filled with amber, encasing the people inside. They discover a man named Roy (Zak Orth) who predicted it and other similar events, and Walter realizes Roy has connections to a past experiment he did over twenty years ago, called the ""Ghost Network""."
82	"The episode was important in the show's evolution, as the writers noted that Roy was the first guest character the audience could get emotionally invested in. ""The Ghost Network"" also included their quest to explain seemingly impossible and weird phenomenon through a real scientific explanation from Walter's past research."
83	It  first aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 23, 2008. An estimated 9.42 million viewers watched the episode on its first broadcast. It received mixed reviews, with many believing the show to be finally finding its legs, while others worried over the ongoing formulaic storylines featured in each episode.
84	"A man named Roy McComb (Zak Orth) confesses to his priest that he sees visions of bad things, including a bus where everyone is going to die. Simultaneously with this scene, a man enters a bus, unleashes a canister emitting gaseous fumes, and steals a backpack before quickly getting off. The Fringe team arrives soon after, only to find the fumes have hardened into an amber-like substance, trapping and killing those inside. Walter (John Noble) studies the substance and concludes it started out as a gas and then solidified, suffocating the passengers. While looking at a victim's video footage, Olivia (Anna Torv) discovers a backpack is missing, and traces it back to one of the victims, a Federal employee with undercover connections to a drug cartel. They interview her ""handler"", who comes to identify her body. The Fringe team finds out about Roy, and search through his apartment, believing he is behind the bus and other Pattern-related terror attacks. They soon realize all of his drawings are dated before the incidents took place, despite the fact that several of them were never made public. In an interrogation, Roy tells Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) he's been receiving his visions for nine months, roughly when they began seeing Pattern-related attacks."
85	"Meanwhile, they trace the substance to Massive Dynamic. Olivia interviews Massive Dynamic executive Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who tells her the substance has been seen in an attack before.  Walter suspects Roy is psychic and runs tests on him before realizing Roy has some kind of magnetic compound in his blood. This leads Walter to recall he and his old lab partner William Bell had conducted research on creating a ""Ghost Network"" to secretly communicate messages from one person to another in an otherwise undetectable frequency range. During this research, Roy was one of his past test subjects. Walter further theorizes that someone else has perfected his research, and that Roy is overhearing secret messages from some of the people behind the terrorist attacks. Olivia and Peter (Joshua Jackson) arrive at his old house to find equipment needed to tap into Roy's mind."
86	Using the equipment, they are able to intercept messages in Latin detailing an upcoming exchange at South Station in an hour. They realize the handler removed a small crystalline disk from the Federal agent's hand when he identified her body, and that he is now going to exchange it for something else. Olivia intercepts the man, who is killed before she can talk to him. She chases another man involved in the exchange, who commits suicide in front of a bus after giving them a briefcase containing the disc. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) secretly gives the disc to Nina for analysis, while Roy is sent home, as they believe he will no longer see visions because the Ghost Network has been compromised.
87	"Executive producer Jeff Pinkner decided he wanted fellow executive producer David H. Goodman and supervising producer J. R. Orci to collaborate in writing the episode; Goodman wrote the first half, while Orci wrote the rest of the episode. The two later worked together on only one other episode, ""The Equation"". Frederick E. O. Toye directed the episode, as he had worked previously with the writers on Alias. The writers had the idea for a couple of weeks of Olivia walking into an apartment and discovering walls covered with drawings of events that ""no man could possibly have known about"". They wanted to take ""urban myths or legends of strange events"" and come up with a fringe science equivalent; this led them to creating the story of Roy, a man with seemingly ""psychic"" abilities, which they then expanded by offering a real scientific explanation in the form of Walter's past research. In the show's early development, the producers were also unsure about how other aspects should be developed, such as Joshua Jackson's character Peter. For instance, in ""The Ghost Network"", they debated whether or not Peter would break into his childhood home before finally ""stalling and just let him do it""; Orci came up with Peter's explanation to Olivia, that he used to live there so it wasn't really breaking in."
88	"The character Roy McComb was played by actor Zak Orth. Roy's name was inspired from Richard Dreyfuss' character Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The writers noted in the audio commentary that Roy was the first guest character the audience could get emotionally invested in. They wanted the actor to shave off his hair in preparation for the experimentation scene in Walter's lab, but Orth successfully ""begged"" them to change their minds. When casting for the part of Grant, the writers looked for a man similar in appearance to previous character John Scott (Mark Valley), as they wanted ""to play into whatever Olivia's feelings about how she was or was not betrayed by John"". Peter Hermann won the part."
89	"Orci came up with the idea to start the episode in a church's confessional, while the ambered scene on the bus was originally scripted to take place on a subway; one of the writers felt the bus ""let you see more of the city"". Early in the show's creation the writers were trying to figure out what Fringe could be, and ultimately chose ""big crazy event[s]"" at the start of each episode that would catapult its plot and drive its characters. They felt the bus scene essentially achieved this. When creating the scene on the bus when the gas canister is released, the crew sat on a bus that was really driving through the streets of New York City; director Frederick Toye called the shooting ""Student film style, run and gun"". To shoot the three scenes of the bus in the tunnel, the crew looked at a variety of locations before choosing a tunnel near the United Nations headquarters on the east side of Manhattan. As it was a busy area, they had to shoot at night and then attempt to make it appear to be daytime, as the scenes were set during the day. They had a limited schedule to shoot all three scenes, and despite never having seen the tunnel before, the production crews had 8–9 hours to quickly set up the massive set and leave enough time to shoot the scenes before dawn approached. To simulate being encased in amber, the actors had to pretend they were frozen.The episode marked the first time composer Michael Giacchino worked with assistant Chad Seiter on a Fringe episode. Seiter would continue to score the rest of the season's first half. Joshua Jackson's character briefly plays the piano in a scene near the end of the episode, and it is really Jackson playing. The writers noted in the audio commentary that Jackson can actually play the piano, and that when he receives musical scenes, he learns the piece(s) beforehand to be able to play it for the scene."
90	"""The Ghost Network"" first aired in the United States on September 23, 2008. The episode's broadcast was watched by an estimated 9.42 million viewers in the US."
91	"The episode received mixed reviews. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining that while he thought it was ""much more fun"" than the previous week's episode and enjoyed Peter's expanded presence, he was growing slightly wearied by the ""hint-dropping"" of Peter's past. Murray thought the climax was ""so exciting"" that he was willing ""to forgive the fact that this is the third week in a row that Walter's big idea has involved some kind of communication with the unconscious"". IGN's Travis Fickett rated it 7.5/10, writing that he thought it was a solid episode because the ""characters are coming together nicely, the story is better than last week's – but already it seems the show is hitting a formula"". Fickett expressed worriment that Fringe would eventually become too formulaic, much like the first season of Smallville, and concluded his review by calling Fringe ""a solid show, but [not] exceptional yet"".Writing for Mania.com, Stephen Lackey thought that though the episode wasn't perfect, Fringe had finally seemed to hit its stride, as its ""mix of humor and darker storytelling... is starting to come together nicely"". Lackey concluded his review by expressing his ""excitement"" at watching Fringe get better and better, and thought the show could become the best new series of the year if it continued to improve with each episode. Another UGO writer, Alex Zalben, compared ""The Ghost Network"" to the similarly-plotted The X-Files film The X-Files: I Want to Believe. Zalben wrote, ""Man, that X-Files movie was just no good. Fringe wins."""

94	"""The Arrival"" is the fourth episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode was written by the series co-creator and executive producer J. J. Abrams and executive producer and show runner  Jeff Pinkner. Paul A. Edwards directed it."
95	"The episode concerns a mysterious cylindrical object called ""The Beacon"" which appears at a construction site in New York City.  The story also involves the relationship between Walter Bishop (John Noble) and the mysterious Observer (Michael Cerveris in his first feature appearance)."
96	"""The Arrival"" first aired in the United States on September 30, 2008 on the Fox Network to more than 10 million viewers. It received positive to mixed reviews, with many praising the new revelations about the Observers."
97	"At a diner in Brooklyn, New York, a bald man with no eyebrows sits down at a table and orders a raw roast beef sandwich with eleven jalapeño peppers and a glass of room temperature water. When the sandwich arrives, he drowns it in Tabasco sauce and black pepper and wolfs it down in large, quick bites, to the bemusement of the diner staff. During this time he is also watching the construction site across the street through high-tech binoculars and taking notes from right to left in unrecognizable characters. The ground shakes and a gas main explodes at the site, toppling a crane. The bald man—the Observer—calmly pays for his sandwich and wanders to the gaping hole where the construction site was. On a wireless phone, he says ""It has arrived."""
98	In their shared hotel room Walter keeps Peter awake by reciting the chemical formula for root beer. The next morning Peter expresses his unhappiness with the arrangement to Olivia (Anna Torv) and tells her he wants to leave. She can't let him do that, telling him that Walter refuses to work without him. The Fringe Team investigates the object that arrived in Brooklyn, a cylinder that is determined to vibrate at a particular frequency. In the course of the investigation, Walter assaults and forcibly sedates Junior Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) in order to hide the cylinder. He later meets with the bald man at a diner.
99	"Meanwhile, a violent criminal named John Mosley (Michael Kelly) is also searching for the Beacon. After killing one of Olivia's mentors, Mosley kidnaps and tortures Peter to find out the location. After he recovers the beacon from the grave of Robert Bishop, John Mosley is taken down by Olivia. The beacon escapes into the earth, and The Observer reports that its departure was ""on schedule."" Peter confronts The Observer about the beacon, only to have a gibberish conversation that implies that the Observer knows what Peter is going to say before he says it, or, as Peter puts it, ""he knew me [...] he was inside my head."" The Observer then knocks Peter out with an advanced sort of stun gun."
100	"After being hospitalized for his injuries, Peter admits to Olivia that his experience with The Observer has caused him to start to believe in The Pattern. Peter decides that he wants to stay with the Fringe team until he gets some explanations. Walter apologizes to Astrid, who doesn't yet forgive him. Walter admits to Peter that, during an accident many years ago, a mysterious third party saved both their lives. The man was bald and had no eyebrows, who ""knew my [Walter's] thoughts before I did."" Walter admits that his behaviour regarding the capsule, and his desire to protect it, was motivated by his debt to this bald man, and that the capsule somehow contained instructions from this man. At the end of the episode, Olivia returns home, and sees recently deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) in her kitchen. He greets her with ""Hello, Liv."""
101	"""The Arrival"" was written by co-creator J. J. Abrams and executive producer Jeff Pinkner. Paul A. Edwards directed the episode, his second of the season. Early in the series, actress Jasika Nicole feared her character was going to become liked by the audience only to suddenly die. She explained that ""When I was reading the script in the episode where Dr. Bishop stabs her in the neck with the sedative … and all [the script] says is, 'Dr. Bishop grabs Astrid from behind and jams the needle into her neck.' Then it fades to black. My mouth hung open for awhile and I was like, 'Oh my God, I only made it through six episodes."""
102	"While Michael Cerveris has appeared as the Observer in the three previous episodes—and has appeared in every episode to date—his previous appearances had been brief background cameos. When initially cast for Fringe, Cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star, and that his character was ""one of several nuggets dropped in"" by J. J. Abrams in a manner similar to his other science fiction series, Lost. Cerveris soon discovered that his character was ""this sort of Where's Waldo thing (as) the linchpin in an overarching story of the series"". He continued:I wasn't told, because I don't think they knew at the time, whether I was a good guy, a bad guy, human, alien, other-dimensional. I just kind of felt my way through it with the first directors and input, obviously, from the writers in the scripts that we had. Even things like wardrobe, they weren't given extremely big instructions, so we kind of worked things out together and just found something we all thought was interesting and iconic and went with that. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented, ""Our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally. He's more specifically connected with the overall character mythology of the show than we ever expected."" The decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared, which caused stress in the make-up department because Cerveris would not shave his eyebrows; he commented about the affair, ""I've got a little too much else going on, and who knows if they would ever grow back. I have little enough hair as it is."" ""The Arrival"" was the first episode in which the Observer had dialogue, and the first in which he was treated as a focal character. In addition to Cerveris, actor Michael Kelly made a guest appearance in the episode.In the episode, a character introduced as ""the Rogue"" has a specialized weapon that fires massive amounts of energy. To simulate the energy gun the Rogue fires at Olivia in the forest, the crew placed pyrotechnic charges near the trees to make it appear large blasts were close to hitting her. In a DVD special feature, one of the crew commented it was ""challenging"" to choreograph the fight scene between The Observer and Peter, because the former does not fight back as he is only there to observe.The DVD special features include a deleted scene, where Peter emphatically denies the existence of parallel universes after Walter implies their existence in a quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet."
103	"More than 10.04 million viewers watched ""The Arrival"" as it was broadcast in the United States, for a 4.3/11 share among viewers 18–49. At the point the episode aired, Fringe was the most watched new show on television in the important 18-49 demographic. Several days after its airing, Fox announced on October 1, 2008 that Fringe had been picked up for a full season order."
104	"The episode's reception ranged from positive to mixed. Critic Maureen Ryan was very positive about the episode in her blog at The Chicago Tribune, writing, ""I liked this week's episode, and for once, it wasn't a case of really wanting to like it and trying to find reasons to see past various flaws. I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)."" Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found ""The Arrival"" a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. ""...After being more than prepared to give ""Fringe"" That's It For Me! status going into the episode, I enjoyed the strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from ""Generation Kill"" toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit... If I can brace myself for the probability that this will all lead to nonsense, I can groove on all the atmospherics along the way. And, if nothing else, Abrams is great at atmosphere."""
105	"Also seeing improvement was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting ""Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, and this is the first time I can really say I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment."" Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onion's A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, ""'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that ""The Arrival"" satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of ""The Arrival"" was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be.""IGN contributor Travis Fickett rated the episode 7.5/10, explaining that he liked the ""attention to bits of logic that work as the glue, holding the show together"" such as Peter's security clearance, but was skeptical of the episode's fringe science. Fickett also noticed many similarities to The X-Files, writing ""not enough is being done to move the show into its own direction""; he concluded ""The production values are exceptional, the acting is top notch, and it certainly seems to be going somewhere. Where, is another matter all together, but there does seem to be momentum."" Website blogger io9 highlighted ""The Arrival"" as one of the ""crucial"" episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named ""The Arrival"" the twelfth best episode of the series, explaining the episode ""formally, memorably introduced the Observer known as September (Michael Cerveris), a Tabasco-loving, Fedora-wearing, bald-headed time traveling surveyor from the future. His altercation with Peter in the graveyard — mirroring his movements; parroting his speech in real time — was one of the show's earliest water-cooler-weird moments."""

108	"""Power Hungry"" is the fifth episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode was written by playwright Julia Cho and consulting producer Jason Cahill, and was directed by Christopher Misiano. The episode focuses on Fringe Division's efforts in finding a man with the uncontrolled ability to affect electrical energy, thanks to the work of a wanted rogue scientist. Meanwhile, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) sees visions of her deceased lover, John Scott (Mark Valley)."
109	"The episode's premise began with the idea of a computer virus being able to spread to humans, which then evolved into the story of a man who comes into his unique abilities. Series consultant Glen Whitman noted the premise was based on the ""very very weak magnetic field"" of electrical energy surrounding humans that an EEG detects, and the writers simply amplified this. The special effects crew undertook much preparation to simulate a chase sequence involving an exploding transformer, leading guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach to note how scary the effect was to film."
110	It first aired in the United States on October 14, 2008 on the Fox network, and was seen by an estimated 9.157 million American viewers, the network's second-highest-rated show for the week. Critical reactions of the episode ranged from mixed to positive, as many believed the series was finally finding its footing. Others, however, critiqued the episode for seeming too ordinary for a science fiction series.
111	Joseph Meegar (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a shy delivery boy who lives with his mother (Marylouise Burke), arrives late for work and delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany (Diane Davis), a receptionist with whom he's infatuated. Afterward, while in an elevator, Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her on his cell phone. Meegar's angst then apparently causes the elevator to fall to the underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar. He is able to walk away unharmed, but is then startled as all the car alarms go off around him.
112	"Olivia reveals to Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) her encounter with her deceased lover John Scott (in the previous episode). She, Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrive at the scene, where they determine that the deceased were electrocuted before the impact, and that the elevator did not fall, but drove down. Furthermore, Walter detects electromagnetic energy in the area. Meanwhile, Meegar inadvertently causes a packaging machine to malfunction, severely injuring his boss right after Meegar is fired. He later reveals to his mother that some time ago he answered a magazine advertisement promising to ""unlock [his] hidden potential"", and although he has no knowledge of what has been done to him, he believes that what he has done was a result of being experimented on. A further panicked Meegar then causes his mother's pacemaker to fail, and she dies."
113	The team becomes aware that a human has the uncontrolled ability to affect electrical energy, made this way by Jacob Fischer (Max Baker). Fischer is a rogue scientist wanted by Interpol, who experimented on humans by luring his victims through bogus ads. Olivia continues to encounter John Scott, who promises her that he does love her, and will prove it. Through him, Olivia realizes that someone survived the elevator impact. Now aware of Meegar's identity, they attempt to track him. However, Meegar is captured by Fischer who wishes to perform further tests on him. Walter finds Meegar's Walkman and uses its cassette tape to find a unique electromagnetic signature, then has homing pigeons guide Olivia, Peter, and Charlie to his location. Alerted by the FBI's arrival, Fischer attempts to leave with Meegar, who escapes. After Fischer is apprehended, Meegar attempts to flee, but he's also caught. They send Meegar to a hospital to be examined.
114	"Walter realizes Olivia is seeing Scott, and reveals she's not hallucinating. He theorizes that when both minds were linked during Scott's coma (in ""Pilot""), a part of Scott's consciousness has embedded itself within hers. Later, while driving home, she spots Scott again. He leads her to a basement where Scott has been running his own Pattern-related investigations. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) hands Olivia some of Scott's personal effects. Among them she finds an engagement ring, proving Scott's claim to have loved her."
115	"""Power Hungry"" was written by consulting producer Jason Cahill and playwright Julia Cho, each of which would go on to write other first season episodes. Christopher Misiano directed the installment. According to Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci, series writers often approached episodes' fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to ""justify it scientifically."" For ""Power Hungry"", Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans. She explained, ""And through kneading that idea over and over again, we came up with the idea of a character, Joseph, who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control electronic- or computer-driven devices."" New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman, who later co-wrote some Fringe episodes, noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible. ""It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains, we do all have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads,"" he said. ""And that's in part what is sensed by an EEG. So the notion was, 'how can you amplify that'""?The chase scene involving Joseph and Olivia required much preparation, as the crew had to simulate an exploding transformer. Special effects coordinator Conrad Brink used a ""mechanical trip"" to support an electrical cable, which he then strung to the other side of the adjacent road using a pole. The crew filled the fuse box with ""sparking devices"", meant to give the appearance of an exploding transformer and power lines. Demonstrating this, Brink noted, ""What happens is the panel cover will blow off, sparks will come out, the cable will go up, sparking down to the ground."" Misiano said of the sequence, ""This young man runs by an electrical box and it blows up. It really blew!"" The director added that guest actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach later told him, ""that was actually really scary"" to film. After he filmed his character hitting Joseph with a crow bar, actor Joshua Jackson joked, ""Finally I'm going to get a little respect on this set.""Mark Valley returns as John Scott. The actor stated that despite the character's death in the pilot; ""I'm going to be showing up in the first season. And, for a guy who died in the pilot, I consider myself pretty fortunate."" Actors who guest star in the episode include Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Joseph Meegar, Max Baker as Jacob Fischer, and Marylouise Burke as Flora Meegar. The first season DVD contains a deleted scene of Olivia and Peter picking up the homing pigeons from a friend of his named Tony. Tony quietly mentions to Peter that his sister could use Peter's help, but when asked, Peter refuses to tell Olivia more of the story."
116	"""Power Hungry"" first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 14, 2008. It was watched by 9.157 million viewers, Fox's second highest rated show for the week. It also earned a 4.2/10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 4.2 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. With time shifted ratings taken into account, viewership rose to 11.05 million seven days after original broadcast."
117	"Critical reactions of the episode ranged from mixed to positive. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10, stating that although it was ""perfectly serviceable, professionally produced television,"" it was ""much like the last week with a little bit of been-there-done-that conspiracy stuff thrown on top of it,"" and that the plot was ""almost boilerplate for this genre."" By this point in the series, the reviewer believed that ""the thing about Fringe that is holding it back is that you're always ahead of it. The show needs to change things up."" Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha, opined; ""Though not the show's best hour to date, 'Power Hungry' is still a solid entry. Good directing, writing, and outstanding production values are maintained as the series' norm."" In addition Griffin enjoyed Fischer's ""casual surrender"", as ""in the past, those associated with 'the pattern' exhibited a fevered desire to avoid capture, going as far as committing suicide. What's this guy's deal? He obviously has a plan."" However the reviewer was skeptical as to why Astrid was comfortable working with Walter again, considering he subdued her in the previous episode.Los Angeles Times reviewer Patrick Kevin Day stated that at this point in the series, he ""initially fretted that Fringe would never grow beyond a run-of-the-mill ""X-Files"" knock-off,"" but now saw the creators' intentions. Sarah Stegall of SFScope called the episode an homage to X-Files episode ""D.P.O."", whose featured character has a similar premise to Meegar. Stegall admitted that ""this show is growing on me,"" with the same atmosphere as The X-Files ""coupled with a slightly better grounding in actual science."" Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend reacted positively towards the episode, commending it as it ""bounced back so quickly from that lame silver cylinder episode or they would've lost me forever."" Dougherty also felt that the three protagonists, Olivia, Walter and Peter, ""are becoming much more believable characters."" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B−, opining that the cold open was the series' best since the pilot, but added that ""despite the added [Freak of the Week] sympathy, 'Power Hungry' promptly peters out, because the level of oddity required for Walter and the Pattern Team to track the Freak down isn't especially high."" Murray added that the return of Scott and his scenes with Olivia ""serves to string along the home viewer, inviting us to question whether Olivia's playing for the right team in this whole Pattern game."" Television Without Pity meanwhile, graded the episode with an A−."

120	"""The Cure"" is the sixth episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. It followed two women suffering from a fictional disease, who are then given radiation drugs and exploited by a pharmaceutical company to cause nearby individuals' brains to boil."
121	"The episode was written by Felicia D. Henderson and Brad Caleb Kane, and directed by Bill Eagles. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner meant for the first six episodes of the first season to serve as a ""prologue"", while the following episodes would get ""into the next chapter"" of the series."
122	"""The Cure"" first aired in the United States on October 21, 2008 on the Fox network to an estimated 8.91 million viewers. It received mixed to negative reviews,  with many critics doubting the plausibility of the science depicted in the episode."
123	In Milford, Massachusetts, men in Hazmat suits drop a woman (Maria Dizzia) out of a white van, who then enters a nearby diner. Suffering from memory loss, the woman becomes irritated under a cop's questioning and causes the other patrons' brains to boil and then explode; she dies soon after in the same fashion.
124	"The Fringe team consisting of Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Walter Bishop (John Noble), and Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) arrive, and Agent Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) briefs them that the woman, Emily Kramer, disappeared two weeks previously, and that her corpse exhibits three times the radiation as the other victims. Upon further investigation of her body, Walter concludes she was suffering from a rare and incurable disease, ""Bellini's lymphocemia,"" but was mysteriously cured. Further tests reveal Kramer was held against her will, and given nootropic drugs intravenously that makes her brain emit a microwave burst, then set loose by her experimenters as a test."
125	"Another woman with the same disease, Claire Williams (Marjan Neshat), is reported missing soon after. Before her disappearance, Claire's husband tells them she also was recently cured. Her captors are shown, commenting that ""the last one was a test, this one counts"". While rifling through Emily's house, Olivia and Peter learn Emily and Claire were friends, and that Emily's husband also knew her despite denying it earlier. He tells them they and other victims of the disease undertook private research and discovered a cure with the help of a physician, Dr. Nadim Patel (Alok Tewari). Before committing suicide, the doctor tells them David Esterbrook (Chris Eigeman), the chief scientist of a competitor of Massive Dynamic, is the one responsible. Olivia confronts Esterbrook at a medical conference to discover his motivations, only to be threatened by him; Broyles admonishes her for intimidating such a high-profile individual in a public setting."
126	To get to the high-profile Esterbrook, Peter makes a deal with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who tells him where to find Claire before she can be turned into a radioactive bomb. The FBI storms the building, and Olivia is able to give Claire the cure before her head explodes. Estebrook arrogantly tells Olivia his lawyers will spring him out of any trouble, and she publicly arrests him to ensure the press finds out, causing his company's stock to dramatically decrease in value. After Broyles lectures her, Olivia tells him her emotions (which she had exhibited strongly all episode) make her a better agent.
127	"In a sideplot, Olivia reveals that she shot her abusive stepfather when she was nine years old, but he survived and disappeared soon after. The strong emotions Olivia exhibited in the episode were because the events take place on her birthday, and her stepfather sends her a card every year to let her know ""he's still out there"". The final scene shows Olivia opening a birthday card from her stepfather."
128	"""The Cure"" was written by co-executive producer Felicia D. Henderson and co-producer Brad Caleb Kane, while filmmaker Bill Eagles directed it. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, executive producer Jeff Pinkner stated that the first six episodes of the first season were a ""prologue"" that ended with ""The Cure,"" and that the following episodes, beginning with ""In Which We Meet Mr. Jones"", were ""getting into the next chapter"" of the series.Pinkner also told the Los Angeles Times that ""Bellini's lymphocemia"", the disease depicted in the episode, was invented by the writers, but its characteristics are real. He elaborated ""We just didn't want to imply that individuals working on their own could cure it. We didn't want to be irresponsible to people with the real disease"". Some critics have noted that ""Bellini's lymphocemia"" may have been a reference to Italian physician and anatomist Lorenzo Bellini.The episode featured one-time guest appearances by actors Chris Eigeman, Maria Dizzia, Marjan Neshat, William Hill, Lisa Emery, Robert Eli, and Alok Tewari. Eigeman's David Esterbrook's assistant was named after Elizabeth Sarnoff, a television writer and producer. Some of her work includes Lost, another series created by J. J. Abrams.For the opening scene, a ""special kind of blood"" was placed in and around the actors' eyes to simulate their brains boiling. For the scene in which the actress is pushed up against a glass door, the special effects department created a device wearing a brown wig with an explosive charge designed to imitate the actress' head exploding. Director Bill Eagles described the scene as ""imagin[ing] an egg in your microwave spinning around and around at high voltage. What happens? Bang! It just explodes."""
129	"On its initial broadcast on October 21, 2008, ""The Cure"" was watched by an estimated 8.91 million viewers in the United States. It garnered a 5.5/8 ratings share for all households, and was Fox's ninth most watched show of the week."
130	"Reviews for the episode ranged from mixed to negative.   TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles ""is surely one of the most intense guys on TV"", and also enjoyed Walter's scenes. Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were ""an odd way to build a mythology: the Big Secret seems to be that people in positions of power are evil and do evil things, often for money. But if Peter's right, and all these stand-alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big Bads in preparation for something... well, that's an exciting idea."" She gave it ""two out of four Expendable Gerbils."" io9's Annalee Newitz praised the episode, declaring it made her ""officially a watcher of Fringe, rather than a sampler"". She continued, ""It was the first time that the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity."""
131	"Further reviews tended to be negative. IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, explaining ""It's starting to feel as if Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe."" Fickett criticized Walter's science and ""silly ranting[s]"", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be ""dangerously close to self-parody."" Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained ""I really don't want any more of this. I'm tired of this formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there when it comes to Agent Dunham."" Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was ""wonky."" The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it ""a long hour of television."" Referring to Olivia's ""feminist"" speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, ""It's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show. But if they're going to focus on a character, it should be Walter — though we shudder to think how his flatulence will factor into the plot."""

134	"""The Equation"" is the eighth episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode follows the Fringe team's investigation into the kidnapping of a young musical prodigy (Charlie Tahan) who has become obsessed with finishing one piece of music. Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) returns to St. Claire's Hospital in an effort to find the boy's whereabouts."
135	"The episode was written by supervising producer J. R. Orci and co-executive producer David H. Goodman, and was directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton. Actress Gillian Jacobs guest starred as the boy's kidnapper. The episode featured her character in a ""pretty violent and quite messy"" fight with Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Torv's first for the series. The two actresses spent several weeks practicing the fight's choreography."
136	"""The Equation"" first aired in the United States on November 18, 2008, garnering an estimated 9.175 million viewers. The episode was the Fox network's fifth ranked show for the week, and helped Fox win the night among adults aged 18 to 49. Critical reception to ""The Equation"" ranged from mixed to positive, with most reviewers praising the asylum storyline."
137	While helping fix a woman's car engine on the side of the road in Middletown, Connecticut, Andrew Stockston (Adam Grupper) sees a sequence of red and green flashing lights and is hypnotized into a suggestive state. Upon 'waking up', he does not have any memory of what happened while hypnotized, but sees that the woman and his son Ben (Charlie Tahan), a young musical prodigy, are missing. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) reveals that similar cases have ended with the victims being returned, but left insane from the trauma of the incident. All the victims were academics and accomplished in their respective fields.
138	"When interviewing Andrew, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) learns that nine months previously, Ben survived a car accident with a new, extraordinary ability to play the piano, despite never taking lessons. Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) recalls memories of red and green lights, but he's unable to remember more. While trying to dredge up the old memories, Walter recounts a previous unsuccessful mind control experiment he had worked on for an advertising agency, who wished to compel customers to buy their products using flashing lights. He deduces that someone succeeded in producing the lights using wavelengths, and these caused Andrew to sustain a ""hypnagogic trance"" that allowed his son to be abducted. He successfully tests an experiment on Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson)."
139	Andrew's sketch leads to the identification of the kidnapper as Joanne Ostler (Gillian Jacobs), a MIT neurologist who was previously believed deceased. Joanne tricks Ben into helping her complete an unfinished equation by using the image of his mother, who died in the car accident. Meanwhile, Walter suddenly remembers that he heard about the lights from former mathematician Dashiell Kim (Randall Duk Kim), an old bunkmate at St. Claire's Hospital who disappeared under similar circumstances. To discover the child's whereabouts, Olivia encourages Walter to return to St. Claire's. The visit does not go well, and Walter is held by hospital administrator Dr. Bruce Sumner (William Sadler), who remains unconvinced of Walter's sanity.
140	"Peter figures out Joanne's assumed name using an FBI database, while Walter manages to convince Kim into giving up a vague description of Joanne's whereabouts by telling him there is a little boy who needs their help. Kim says he was kept in ""a dungeon in a red castle."" Olivia and Peter use the information to find the boy once they arrange for Walter's release. However, Joanne escapes with the completed formula, which she gives to Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly). Loeb kills her, but not before using the equation to allow him to pass through solid matter."
141	"""The Equation"" was written by supervising producer J. R. Orci and co-executive producer David H. Goodman. Both would go on to separately write other first season episodes, including Orci's ""The Transformation"" and Goodman's ""Safe"", which resolved the fate of the eponymous equation. ""The Equation"" was directed by filmmaker Gwyneth Horder-Payton, her first and only credit for the series to date.The episode featured guest actress Gillian Jacobs as the kidnapper Joanne Ostler. Jacobs explained her character's motivations, ""I'm a very mysterious figure, and at the beginning of the episode you see that I have taken this boy, have kidnapped him. I have taken him to this room and have him hooked him up to these EKG machines. I'm trying to get him to finish writing this piano piece which I need to help solve an equation... It's very important to me.""Horder-Payton considered the confrontation between Olivia and Joanne to be the former's ""first big fight scene."" She added, ""It's been well choreographed and they've been practicing for several weeks."" According to Torv, she and Jacobs broke the moves down ""really simply"" and then ""put them together into really small little bits."" The director called it a ""pretty violent and quite messy"" fight, to which first assistant director Colin MacLellan added, ""It's a pretty phenomenal brawl actually to have two women kick the crap out of each other.""The first season DVD includes several scenes that were omitted from the final cut of the episode. The first centers on Walter waking up in the middle of the night, explaining to a disgruntled Peter that he's attempting to ""shift my circadian rhythm to the nocturnal cycle."" The other scene shows Olivia and Peter playing poker, which leads her to realize an important part of the episode's case."
142	"Flashing multicolored lights, specifically red and green, are a consistent theme of the first season, with Into the Looking Glass: Exploring the Worlds of Fringe author Sarah Clarke Stuart calling them ""noteworthy recurring images."" They can also be seen in the computer graphics of the Observer's binoculars, as well as during the second and third seasons as a way to distinguish the two universes.The character of Walter goes through much development during the first season. Stuart believed that he changes the most out of the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, ""We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw when we first met him. It's a very interesting journey we see Walter go through.""In the episode, Walter sees himself several times while staying in the mental institution. Many reviewers expressed curiosity about this ""Visitor"" or ""Second Walter"". After looking through ""Walter's Lab Notes,"" released by Fox after each episode, Ramsey Isler of IGN speculated that Walter suffered from a multiple personality disorder, while AOL TV's Jane Boursaw thought it was either an hallucination or his alternate universe counterpart."
143	"""The Equation"" first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on November 18, 2008. It was watched by an estimated 9.18 million viewers, earning a 4.1/10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 4.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. The episode also received a 5.6/8 ratings share among all households. Fringe and its lead-in show, House M.D., helped Fox win the night in the adult demographic, as it was Fringe's highest rating since the season's second episode. It was Fox's fifth ranked show for the week."
144	"The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Fearnet columnist Alyse Wax called it a ""pretty good episode"", and believed it to be ""far more enjoyable than last week's"", as it lacked that episode's ""conspiracy nonsense"" and John Scott storyline. However, Wax continued that ""The Equation"" ""seemed rather pedestrian"" because ""nothing too freaky"" happened, and wished that Walter and Peter had been used more.  Jane Boursaw of AOL TV considered Walter's return to the asylum ""heartbreaking"".IGN's Travis Fickett rated ""The Equation"" 7.5/10, and called it a ""solid episode"" despite a few perceived plotholes. He liked Walter and Peter's actions in the asylum, and concluded ""At this point, whether a solid single episode is enough to keep you watching Fringe likely has to do with your overall patience with the series and whatever its ultimate goals might be."" Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend called it the best episode since ""The Same Old Story"" since it contained ""suspense and drama and a minimal amount of conspiracy theories"", making her feel ""seriously giddy"". While still calling it ""entertaining"", she disliked Walter seeing himself in the asylum, believing it ""was really strange and didn’t go with the flow of the story"".The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded the episode with a B+, explaining that he believed it to be mainly an original story; what kept him from promoting it to the ""elusive 'A' level–something no Fringe episode has yet done for me"" was the ending, which was ""like something out of dozens of mediocre cop shows"". Despite this, Murray found it and the asylum storyline to be ""compelling"". Conversely, UGO Networks was critical of the episode, writing ""Fringe continues to wobble in story quality. Last night's episode was a perfectly good way to waste an hour, but far off the track of last week's episodes. The episode featured some plot conveniences that were a bit hard to swallow""."

148	"""The Dreamscape"" is the ninth episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. It centers on a Fringe investigation of a Massive Dynamic employee who, after believing himself to be under attack by a swarm of sharp-winged butterflies, jumps out of a window. Meanwhile, Olivia (Anna Torv) continues her visions of the deceased John Scott (Mark Valley), and discovers how he is related to a deadly psychoactive drug synthesized by Massive Dynamic."
149	"""The Dreamscape"" was written by series staff writers Julia Cho and Zack Whedon, and was directed by Fred Toye. To create the opening scene, they ""relied entirely on actor performance,"" with guest actor Ptolemy Slocum simulating being cut, freezing for the crew to apply prosthetic make-up, and then unfreezing to continue shooting the scene. VFX coordinator Christopher Stollard wished the computer-generated butterflies to look as realistic as possible, and modeled them after mounted butterfly specimens his team studied."
150	"The episode first aired in the United States on November 25, 2008 on the Fox network. It was watched by an estimated 8.73 million viewers and earned a 3.9/10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49. Reviews of the episode were mixed, with one reviewer believing it ""certainly moves [the series] in the right direction""."
151	Massive Dynamic executive Mark Young (Ptolemy Slocum) delivers a presentation at the company’s Manhattan office. When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing to go out to dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.
152	"Later, in the lab at Harvard, Walter's autopsy reveals a synthetic compound in Mark's blood, though any link to the cuts is not yet known to them. Olivia receives an email from someone who claims to be John Scott, listing an address for her to visit. Upon arriving she finds boxes, one of which contains a group of toads. At the lab, Walter finds that the toads contain a ""psychoactive compound"", a hallucinogen that affects the fear center of the brain. They conclude that Mark’s brain was so convinced of something happening to his body that actual physical marks appeared. Mark was infected with a large dosage, leading them to attribute his death to murder."
153	"Olivia admits to Walter how she found the address and learns that her brain still contains some of John's memories. Wishing to discover what else John knew and prevent any further visions from occurring, Olivia insists on returning to Walter’s sensory deprivation tank. Inside the tank, Olivia sees a memory of John in a restaurant. Despite Walter's vehement protest that it is impossible, Olivia is convinced that John Scott saw her. Afterward, she sees John meeting with Mark and two other unidentified men. After Mark and another man leave, John kills the other man. Olivia believes the group were looking to sell the compound as a street drug, and she's able to track down the other man, George Morales (Yul Vazquez). Once apprehended, he denies killing Mark and demands immunity and protection from Massive Dynamic, who he believes was responsible for Mark's death as well as other recent fringe events. Olivia confronts Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) about her suspicions, but George is murdered before he can be of further help to them. Later that night, Olivia gets another email from John Scott simply saying, ""I SAW YOU. IN THE RESTAURANT."""
154	Meanwhile, Peter (Joshua Jackson) is contacted by Tess (Susan Misner), a woman from his past who warns him to leave Boston. When he meets her, Peter intuits that she is being abused by her boyfriend Michael (David Vadim). He ambushes Michael and warns him not to touch Tess again. Michael then informs local crime boss Worth (Tom Riis Farrell) that Peter is back in town.
155	"""The Dreamscape"", the season's ninth episode, was co-written by staff writer Zack Whedon and playwright Julia Cho. It was Whedon's first contribution to the series, and Cho's second. In an interview fifteen days before the broadcast of ""The Dreamscape"", showrunner and executive producer Jeff Pinkner stated that it and several surrounding episodes would be ""stand-alone in quality, but at the same time we [will] start to peel back another layer of the onion"" to transition the second half of the season into a ""new chapter."" Anna Torv later commented that she wished for Olivia to ""lighten up"" during the first season, ""but every time she did, something would happen."" The writers inputted small scenes to shine more light on her character, which included Olivia dressing up for a night out but then ""the phone rings. It’s Broyles, and she wipes the lipstick off, puts on a coat, and goes out. That’s it. You’re on call. She breaks my heart.""Fred Toye served as the episode director, his second after directing ""The Ghost Network"" six installments earlier. To create the opening scene of character Mark Young being ""attacked"" by butterflies, Toye shot it in multiple phases. Series co-creator Roberto Orci preferred the opening scene to involve a ""more subtle"" death, so Young was made to die from falling out a window, which was ""a real thing, something that's not imagined or whimsical"". VFX coordinator Christopher Stollard stated that his crew ""relied entirely on actor performance,"" with guest actor Ptolemy Slocum communicating often with the crew during filming. He shot his scenes in short bursts. Slocum summarized that he ""would experience the [butterfly] cut and then we would freeze, apply make-up [to create the cut on his skin], and then unfreeze and move on"" filming. On his first day, Slocum stated that he wore more than 75 individual prosthetics over his entire chest and arms.Stollard wished the butterflies to be as realistic as possible, and modeled them after mounted butterfly specimens his team studied. The butterflies were computer generated animations and added later in post-production. To create the illusion of Young falling through the window, the visual effects crew placed small explosive charges on the tempered glass window; Slocum's stuntman Jared Burke then jumped through while they triggered the glass to explode. Two cameras, one high and one profile, were positioned to shoot the fall, and were composited together later into a matte painting of the World Trade Building. The fall was filmed multiple times with a green screen, with the stuntman falling on a cushion. While on-set, Toye explained of the shoot, ""with all the pieces put together with the visual effects and with the performance we got with our actor Ptolemy, it's going to be fabulous."" A crewman believed that the addition of music to Young's fall made the scene ""far more elegant and more of a statement."" In a December 2012 interview, actress Jasika Nicole stated that she developed a fear of butterflies as a result of this episode."
156	"""The Dreamscape"" first aired on November 25, 2008 in the United States on the Fox network. With its timeslot dominated by the Dancing With the Stars season finale, Fringe attracted an estimated 8.73 million viewers, down from the previous week's audience of 9.36 million. This placed it in third place in its timeslot, behind The Mentalist. The episode also came in third place among viewers aged 18–49, as it earned a 3.9/10 ratings share; this means that it was seen by 3.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast.Fringe's marketing team designed and launched www.massivedynamic.com near the beginning of the first season. Parts of the website can be seen in ""The Dreamscape"", including on Olivia's computer as she researches the company."
157	"Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was generally favorable to the episode, giving it a B+. He wrote, ""Much like Fringe fan favorite 'The Arrival' (not a favorite of mine, sorry to say), 'The Dreamscape' is an episode more involved with insinuation and mythology-building than with telling a complete-in-one story. But perhaps because I've come to trust Fringe more over its recent run of entertaining episodes, I enjoyed it fairly well, and found myself trying to figure out what kind of thematic connections I could make using the notion of the body reacting to mere thoughts."" Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.8/10, explaining that it ""certainly moves in the right direction"". Fickett found the ""coolest moment"" to be when Olivia witnesses John Scott's memory, and he also appreciated Peter's backstory (""It's more than Peter usually gets, but what we know isn't much and isn't very exciting.""). Fickett criticized Olivia however for leaving the man at the hospital unsuitably protected."
158	"SFScope reviewer Sarah Stegall enjoyed Peter's sideplot and hoped to learn more of his past, but thought the ""cute in-jokes"" were meant to distract the audience from a ""thin"" plot ""full of holes"". She added that ""the shallow, cookie-cutter plotting"" was starting to annoy her, and noted that while the series had the potential to become ""a breakout show like The X-Files or Lost... its major weakness is the continual reliance on the worn-out cliché of the Big Bad Corporation,"" which had become ""stale and dry.""Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad wrote, ""Another great episode tonight, and some of the little symbols we see leading into commercials were actually in tonight's episode,"" referring specifically to the hallucinatory butterflies and the frogs/toads found in the basement. Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times took notice here of the pattern of Easter eggs teasing the next episode of the series.  This feature of the show had earlier been touched on in an interview with showrunner Jeff Pinkner.  As an example, the previous episode ""The Equation"" had contained a shot of a butterfly on a trashcan, foreshadowing the hallucinated butterfly attack in this episode.In a 2016 retrospective of the series, A.V. Club writer Joshua Alston considered ""The Dreamscape"" as a strong example of Fringe's ""monster of the week"" episodes that predominated the first season, showing ""how much effort and imagination went into the self-contained stories""."

It begins when a group uses technology to walk through a bank's wall and steal a safe deposit box. Its contents contain special equipment meant to ultimately break David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) out of his Frankfurt jail."
163	"The episode was written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman and executive producer Jason Cahill, and was directed by Michael Zinberg. ""Safe"" featured guest starring performances from Harris, Chance Kelly (as Mitchell Loeb), James Frain (as Salman Kohl), and Michael Cerveris (as the Observer)."
164	"The episode first aired in the United States on December 2, 2008 on the Fox network. An estimated 8.54 million viewers watched ""Safe"", making it Fox's fourth most watched show of the week. It premiered to mostly positive reviews, with some believing it improved the entire season by providing more meaning to previous episode mysteries. IGN ranked it as the seventh best episode of the entire series in 2013."
165	At Philadelphia Mutual Savings Bank, a group of men led by Agent Mitchell Loeb break in and use a machine that makes it possible to walk through the bank's wall. Several men pass through the wall and steal a safe deposit box numbered 610. One of the men is unable to make it back through, however, before the wall solidifies again, and he is left stuck inside the wall; Loeb shoots him in the head to prevent him from talking, and they leave.
166	Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrive to investigate, and Broyles says this is the third robbery where a large safe deposit box has been taken. Olivia says she recognizes the victim as Raul Lugo from their time in the Marines together. Peter and Walter go to a local hardware store and buy an electric saw to cut the man out of the wall.
167	Meanwhile in Frankfurt, imprisoned biochemist David Robert Jones is visited by his lawyer Mr. Kohl (James Frain), who tells Jones that the job in Philadelphia was successful. Jones tells Kohl to wire Loeb another $100,000, and he makes a list of items he needs Kohl to bring on his next visit. Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not remember their meeting. She says the only people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end when they find out that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.
168	The boxes are found to have been bought with bogus names and cash 23 years ago. Raul's amputated forearm is examined and discovered to be radioactive, leading Walter to conclude these are after effects of using the technology to pass through walls. Olivia and Peter go to a bar to find out information about Raul from one of his old friends, who says Raul has spent much of his time at the VA. While there, Peter realizes the numbers of the stolen safe deposit boxes match numbers Walter continually spouts off at night. When they confront him, Walter says it is the Fibonacci sequence, and he then realizes that the safe deposit boxes are his. Walter tries to remember what he put in the boxes and where the next two are. Meanwhile, Broyles discovers the VA that Raul went to was in Washington, D.C., leading Olivia to find out Raul and three other patients were in a chess club together. The FBI discovers these men bought a plane ticket to Providence, and Walter remembers which bank he would've used to store something. But when Olivia and Charlie arrive at the bank, the safe deposit box has already been stolen. When they are fleeing, Olivia is able to wound and capture one of the men.
169	"Kohl arrives with Jones' requested items and is told to come the following morning with some paperwork. Jones also asks Kohl for one more thing: Olivia. Peter insists on interrogating the wounded man himself and tells him he has radiation poisoning. The man breaks down and says he was hired freelance but does not know his boss's name. He says all he knows is that his crew is going to a field in Westford, and Olivia figures out it is Little Hill, a word previously given to Jones. Walter remembers the machine he built that is hidden in the safe deposit boxes is able to ""retrieve anyone from anywhere"". Loeb and his remaining team begin setting up at Little Hill, while Jones kills Kohl in Frankfurt. Jones puts on Kohl's suit and is seen preparing for something by putting on suntan lotion and eye drops. While the FBI converge on Little Hill, Olivia is attacked and captured en route by Loeb's forces. Jones is successfully teleported from Frankfurt to Little Hill."
170	"""Safe"" was written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman and consulting producer Jason Cahill, while Michael Zinberg served as the episode's director. It was Goodman's third contribution to the series and Cahill's second. It was the only Fringe episode by Zinberg, a prolific television director who has directed over eighty other television series. Along with ""The Equation"", ""Safe"" resolved much of the storyline surrounding Mitchell Loeb (played by guest actor Chance Kelly), as it addressed how Loeb's team desired to use the equation. The episode featured guest stars James Frain as Salman Kohl, Jared Harris as David Robert Jones, and Michael Cerveris as the Observer.During the first half of its first season, Fringe staff and critics noted that the series was still trying to define itself and its characters. The writers worked on balancing serialized storytelling with standalone plots and had to contend with continuous rewrites and expensive last-minute reshoots. For them, ""Safe"" marked a turning point in the series. They turned David Robert Jones into a recurring character and began to give Olivia more of a personal life. Actor Lance Reddick, who portrays Agent Broyles, later explained in an interview how important the episode was to the evolution of the series, ""We found who we were in episode 10, the episode where Olivia got kidnapped... We were trying to hedge our bets and trying to be too many kinds of shows at once. I'm not saying we got rid of the procedural element because each episode still is on a case – a case in terms of the quote-unquote police work — but it's not formulaic, not like the early episodes. What keeps the show most watchable is the fact that it is character-based."""
171	"""Safe"" first broadcast in the United States on December 2, 2008. It was watched by an estimated 8.54 million viewers, making it the Fox network's fourth most watched show of the week. The episode garnered a 5.3/8 household ratings share and a 3.6/9 among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 3.6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. It was the last Fringe episode of 2008 and it began the mid-season break, as the next episode, ""Bound"", aired in January."
172	"Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode 9.5/10, writing ""This wasn't just a good episode – it was great. It capitalized on absolutely every scrap of promise the show has had in its first nine episodes. Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably going to want to tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important"". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that ""Safe"" could have been used as the series' pilot. ""The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place"". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode ""was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have to do is keep it up""."
173	"The A.V. Club's Zach Handlen graded the episode with an A−, praising the opening as ""quite good"" and believing the tie between Walter and his past research ""changes the game"" (""Having Walter be, in a way, the source of the current disturbance suddenly made everything that much more important""). Jane Boursaw of TV Squad liked the revelation about Walter's safe deposit boxes, but questioned Olivia's logic to get out of her SUV when fleeing her kidnappers. SFScope's Sarah Stegall exclaimed, ""Now this is science fiction! I was absolutely thrilled by this week's episode"". She elaborated by praising Olivia's ""B story"" about her and John Scott's memories, the series' use of ""cold-blooded"" villains, and believed ""the elements of the show are finally achieving some balance."" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted ""Wow. Fringe brings its first chapter to a close, and it really does feel like the end of a chapter. What started as the 'wacky science project of the week' builds to an episode that feels like a mini season finale.""Television Without Pity gave the episode an A, while website blogger io9 highlighted ""Safe"" as one of the ""crucial"" episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named ""Safe"" the eighth best episode of the series, explaining that it ""centered on a character that might be Fringe's most memorable villain, the charismatic mastermind David Robert Jones, played by Mad Men's Jared Harris. His second appearance — built around a clever jail break involving teleportation — made for a riveting and much-needed outing, as it landed right at a time when many critics and viewers were beginning to doubt."" IGN found the episode to be the seventh best of the series, noting it as a turning point for the show."

It follows the aftermath of Olivia's (Anna Torv) capture in the previous episode, and subsequent efforts to identify and apprehend her kidnappers. Along with a double agent, Olivia's investigation is hampered by the appearance of Sanford Harris, an old adversary hired to audit Fringe Division."
178	"The episode was written by series co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci, as well as executive producer Jeff Pinkner. Frederick E. O. Toye served as the episode's director, and sought to create a ""creepy and weird"" atmosphere for Olivia's kidnapping scene to help emphasize her ""terrible circumstances."" First director Gary Rake believed Olivia's action scenes took her to a ""higher level"", and Torv herself enjoyed filming them. In addition, the episode was the first to feature Ari Graynor as Olivia's sister, Rachel. Other guest actors included Chance Kelly, Michael Gaston, Lily Pilyblad, Sara Wilson, Stephen Schnetzer, and Peter Jay Fernandez."
179	"The episode first aired on January 20, 2009 on the Fox network, and was watched by an estimated 11.96 million viewers. ""Bound"" received generally positive reviews from television critics, as many viewed it as an improvement over previous episodes. Actor Joshua Jackson noted the importance of ""Bound"" developmentally for the series. At the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, the episode was submitted in the ""Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series"" and ""Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series"" categories. Both were unsuccessful in securing nominations."
180	"Following Olivia Dunham's (Anna Torv) kidnapping from the previous episode, ""Safe"", Fringe Division works to find her location. Unbeknownst to her, one of Olivia's captors is Fringe agent Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly). He gives her a spinal tap and returns to help with the investigation. Olivia fights off the remaining men and escapes, taking several medical samples with her. She hides the samples right before being arrested by Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston), a former adversary who was hired to audit Fringe Division. Years before, Olivia exposed and prosecuted Harris for sexually assaulting three female Marine privates, and he now wants revenge. Now recovering in Boston Hospital, Olivia's judgment is questioned by Harris for working with the mentally unstable scientist Walter Bishop (John Noble) and his law-breaking son Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson). Harris tells her she cannot investigate her own abduction."
181	Back at Fringe Division, Olivia learns that the building she was kept at is empty and contains no traces of her captors. Olivia, along with Walter and Peter, recovers the hidden samples. They soon hear of the murder of epidemiologist Miles Kinberg, who was killed by a chemical which created a giant, slug-like single cell of acute viral nasopharyngitis in his stomach. Olivia learns that Kinberg was about to start a job at the Centers for Disease Control, and that another scientist, Dr. Russell Simon, is also set to begin working there. She connects Kinberg's killers with her own captors based on the similarities of her stolen samples. Fringe Division brings Simon in for protection but he is killed soon after when Loeb gives him the same chemical agent.
182	"Meanwhile, Olivia's sister Rachel (Ari Graynor) and niece Ella (Lily Pilblad) come to visit. Olivia succeeds in connecting the murder to Loeb by recognizing his shoes from when she was a captive. She goes to search his house but accidentally runs into his wife and accomplice, Samantha (Trini Alvarado). Loeb tells his wife to kill Olivia, and after a struggle, Olivia fatally shoots Samantha. Olivia obtains the necessary evidence to capture Loeb and questions him about her abduction. She gets little information until she shows him pictures of his dead wife, as he was unaware she was killed. Loeb angrily tells Olivia about ""two sides"" and that he was trying to save her."
183	"""Bound"" was written by co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci, and executive producer Jeff Pinkner. Producer Frederick E. O. Toye worked as the director. For Olivia's spinal tap scene, Toye attempted to create a ""creepy and weird"" atmosphere. He explained, ""She's strapped down, she's in a gurney. They're going to pull fluid out of her spine. It's creepy and weird. That's what we're going for, to try and set it up as a really awkward, horrible environment to be trapped in."" Toye and the crew wanted to make it ""as visually interesting and dramatic as possible,"" and added in dripping water and ""creepy"" lighting to emphasize Olivia's ""terrible circumstances."" First assistant director Gary Rake noted that the episode ""took the character Olivia to a higher level... She's a lot more active, which is very exciting for us."""
184	"According to Orci, the idea behind the episode's fringe case originated with the show's ""amazing scientific consultants,"" who suggested ""super-sizing a common virus"" when the writers were trying to brainstorm episode cases. Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, considered it one of the most challenging effects his company made for the season.Up to the point the episode aired, Anna Torv considered it her favorite episode, explaining, ""In ‘Bound,’ when Olivia gets kidnapped, they’re giving her a spinal tap and she wakes up and breaks out – it was just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. I found it really easy to follow and kind of energetic, and I really loved filming that."" In reference to Trini Alvarado, the other actress in their fight scene, Torv also mentioned when shooting it ""We had so much fun! That's probably my favorite sequence in the show thus far.""Actor Joshua Jackson believed the episode was important developmentally for the series, explaining it was ""creatively when the show really hit its stride in the first season."" Jackson continued, ""I think right around the midway point of [the first] season the show decided what it wanted to be. From about the midway, point it got on a pretty good streak of episodes. I can’t remember the exact number, but the two-part episode where Dunham gets kidnapped. After that, it was pretty clear; we introduced the bad guys for the season and there was a much clearer narrative drive through the rest of the season.""In December 2008, Entertainment Weekly reported that actress Ari Graynor would be joining the cast as a guest star for a minimum of three episodes, beginning in January. Her character, Olivia's younger sister Rachel, would be visiting Olivia for a few weeks because ""she's dealing with some man trouble back home"", as described by an insider. ""Bound"" marked the first episode to feature the new character. Other guest actors included Chance Kelly, Michael Gaston, Lily Pilyblad, Sara Wilson, Stephen Schnetzer, and Peter Jay Fernandez."
185	"""Bound"" was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 20, 2009.

186	"""Bound"" has received generally positive reviews from television critics. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated ""Bound"" 9.6/10, explaining that the episode is ""an energetic start to second half of the season, and it's hopefully a sign of things to come."" Olivia's ""amazing"" action sequence reminded Isler of the Fox television show 24, and he equated Olivia with that series' protagonist Jack Bauer. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen also praised the ""badassery"" of the opening sequence as well as Olivia herself; he graded the episode with an A, calling it ""a gripping, bizarre, occasionally wince-inducing hour of television; after a spotty first half of the season, Fringe is finally hitting its stride."" Jane Boursaw of TV Squad enjoyed the episode; like Isler, she also compared Olivia to Jack Bauer, and expressed suspicion that new characters Rachel and Ella were ""part of a bigger conspiracy"".Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha compared Olivia to the character Sydney Bristow from the television series Alias, and opined that Fringe ""continues to exhibit a satisfying stride."" Griffin however was disappointed that events from the previous episode were ignored, believing it to be a mistake to continue emphasising formulaic storytelling rather than a serialized format. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times felt that despite the extra ten minutes, ""Bound"" was ""more like a two-hour episode... being crammed into half the time"". He thought the episode's four writers were ""all busy"", as there were three stories going on at once, and compared Olivia to the similarly characterized Lost character Jack Shephard. Hanson concluded, ""But how bad can it be when my biggest complaint about a show is that I want more? And now that the cold winter of reruns has passed, we should be getting just that.""Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B. Various reviewers disliked the character Sanford Harris, calling him ""stereotypical, ""one-note"", and ""unconvincing."" Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly noted the episode's importance in the series' history, and named it the ninth best episode of the series, explaining ""Arriving midway through Fringe's shaky first season, 'Bound' was billed as a reboot that applied lessons learned from earlier episodes. (The plot mirrored the critical tune-up, with a cranky internal affairs agent conducting an audit on Fringe division.) The key focus: Making Olivia a richer, warmer, more proactive character. Mission accomplished. So began a series of rookie year corrections that helped Fringe find its voice."""

191	It first aired in the United States on January 27, 2009, on the Fox Broadcasting Company.
192	The core trio of the Fringe department—Olivia, Walter, and Peter—investigate the death of a teenager whose brain has been liquefied after watching a video sent to his computer. A car salesman and a stepfather are targeted next and become part of the investigation. All of the victims are connected to a disgruntled high-level computer programmer (Chris Bauer) who has lost his job and whose whereabouts are unknown. The murderer then sends the video to Olivia's laptop and almost kills her niece Ella, but Olivia bursts into the apartment and is able to intervene. In order to catch the suspect, Olivia defies an order from Agent Harris; she allows the programmer's son to be released in order to track him. Broyles puts his friendship with Harris on the line to defend her.
193	The episode was co-written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman and co-producer Brad Caleb Kane; it was Goodman's fourth of six episodes he wrote for the series, and Kane's second of three. It was directed by John Polson, his only directing credit for the series.
194	"To achieve the effect of the arm reaching through the computer monitor, an actor wore a green screen sleeve on his arm and reached through the computer monitor which had also been fitted with a green background. In post-production, visual effects supervisor Jay Worth replaced the green portions with a computer generated animated arm that interacted with the character on-screen. One crew member commented that rather than use all special effects, they wanted to ""get the articulation of an actual arm. We get the physicality which is pretty hard to fake of a hand striking somebody, so that helps us sell that contact."""

199	"""The Transformation"" is the thirteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. Its storyline centers on the circumstances surrounding a deceased scientist (Neal Huff), who was doped with a ""designer virus"" and transformed into a dangerous monster, causing his plane to crash. Fringe agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and FBI consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) connect the event to an impending arms deal. Olivia must explore her mind for remaining memories of her former partner and lover, John Scott (Mark Valley), in order to prevent the sale of the virus."
200	The episode was co-written by Zack Whedon and supervising producer J. R. Orci, while producer Brad Anderson served as the director. The creation of the monster took the crew approximately eleven days—they took molds of guest actor Huff's head and back and created eight sets of dentures in order to create the special effect of transformation. To create the plane crash set, the crew spent over a week strategically placing around 15,000 pounds' worth of plane parts.
201	It was first screened at PaleyFest in November 2008. On February 3, 2009, the episode was broadcast in the United States on Fox to an estimated 12.78 million viewers. The episode earned a 5/6.5 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, finishing in eighth place for the week. It received generally positive reviews. Commentators have noted allusions to the pilot and a fourth-season episode, in addition to the television series Lost and H. G. Wells' novel The Island of Doctor Moreau.
202	"On an airplane in flight, scientist Marshall Bowman (Neal Huff) gets a nosebleed, and he tries to warn the crew to give him sedatives or use force against him. He locks himself in the lavatory before he transforms into a beast and bursts out, causing havoc in the plane and leading to a crash in Scarsdale, New York. The Fringe team arrives on the scene and discover the beast's body. Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) concludes that it started out as a human. Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) recognizes Bowman's picture from John Scott's (Mark Valley) memories, realizing that Bowman was flying to meet another man in the memories named Daniel Hicks (Felix Solis). Back at the lab at Harvard, Walter finds a small crystalline disc implanted in the beast's hand similar to one seen inside the woman killed in ""The Ghost Network"", and thinks Marshall was dosed with a ""designer virus""."
203	"Hicks is brought in for questioning. After beginning to transform into a beast, he admits that ""Conrad"" dosed them before Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) pauses the process by administering a sedative and placing him in an induced coma. Walter develops an antidote, while Olivia finds another small disc in Hicks' hand. Her demand to see Scott's body leads her and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) to Massive Dynamic, where Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) tells her that the information gleaned from Scott's body implicates him in a bioterrorist cell with the other two."
204	French intelligence states that weapons manufacturer Conrad is involved in a sale, leading to Olivia returning to the sensory deprivation tank in order to find out more from Scott's memories. In a motel room they used to share, Scott talks to Olivia, scaring her into shooting him. Olivia next appears in an alleyway, where she follows Scott into a memory of him almost killing Conrad. He reveals that he, Hicks, and Marshall are all undercover government agents for the NSA, and tells Olivia to ask Hicks where the meeting is going to happen. They awake Hicks, who tells them more about the weapons sale.
205	Being given details from a secret radio by Hicks, Olivia pretends to be the weapons buyer, and is accompanied by Peter. They successfully make contact, but the sellers become suspicious after Hicks' transformation restarts, depriving Olivia of the necessary information. Conrad makes his appearance and realizes Olivia and Peter are lying; just before he orders them killed, the FBI moves in and arrests the sellers.
206	The episode ends with Walter telling Olivia her brain waves are going back to normal, and that Scott's memories are fading from her mind. Olivia requests to enter the tank regardless, and she makes a last encounter with Scott, where he tells her he loved her and was going to marry her. She bids farewell to his consciousness, which has finally left her own.
207	"""The Transformation"" was co-written by Zack Whedon and supervising producer J.R. Orci. Whedon had last co-written the season's ninth episode, ""The Dreamscape"", while Orci helped write ""The Equation"", the season's eighth episode. Producer Brad Anderson served as director, his latest Fringe work since directing ""In Which We Meet Mr. Jones"" six episodes earlier. The episode resolved the John Scott storyline and featured the last appearance of actor Mark Valley. Media outlets speculated that because Valley and Torv married over the holiday break, his departure ""would eliminate any chances of the marriage conflicting with the show."" Co-creator Roberto Orci called Scott's final scene a ""truly satisfactory conclusion to his story.""The creation of the monster took the series special effects crew approximately eleven days to implement. They created molds of guest actor Neal Huff's head and back, giving him ""creature eye"" contact lenses and covering the back foam mold with ""backbarbs"". Eight different dentures were made of Huff's mouth to depict the character gradually losing his teeth, ""anything from simple teeth that match his own..., to wiggling teeth that he can start to loosen up, to ones where he's already started to lose a tooth,"" explained Special Effects Makeup crewman Stephen Kelley. Each denture appliance took about a day to create. The final version of the creature, Kelley noted, was ""very exaggerated... He's got the big giant quills coming off it like a porcupine. And it's also got six nipples on it, which is part of us trying to investigate what this creature actually it is.""Andrew Orloff, the creative director and visual effects supervisor of Zoic Studios, considered the creature one of the most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are ""really super fantastical, they're really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things—to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we've faced on the show so far."" During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a ""were-upine"" or ""porcuman"". Lance Reddick commented on set, ""When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with."" The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds' worth of plane parts.Though the episode first aired in February 2009, ""The Transformation"" had an early screening at the November 2008 PaleyFest, where Fringe's producers answered questions from the audience. When asked in an interview if the ""giant germ"" from ""Bound"" was the grossest thing of the season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner replied that ""the huge porcupine man on the airplane [from ""The Transformation""] was more shocking. It was so unexpected."" At the time ""The Transformation"" aired, Joshua Jackson considered it the series' best episode. John Noble called it ""grotesque"" and ""possibly one of the more gruesome ones we've done."""
208	"In her 2011 book Into the Looking Glass: Exploring the Worlds of Fringe, author Sarah Clarke Stuart observed that two unrelated Fringe characters, Conrad Moreau of ""The Transformation"" and Moreau (Brad Dourif) of ""The Day We Died"", are allusions to H. G. Wells' 1896 novel The Island of Doctor Moreau. Both are ""scientifically inspired men with questionable integrity,"" while Wells' Doctor Moreau is an ""unethical researcher"" who fell ""under the overmastering spell of research,"" in a vein similar to Walter.Like the pilot episode, ""The Transformation"" begins on the passenger section of an airplane in flight. Actor Mark Valley was asked how the episode differed from the pilot, leading him to joke that ""it's a completely different airline this time."" His character, John Scott, was first seen in an episode about a plane disaster; accordingly, IGN expressed, it made sense thematically to have his last appearance be in an episode about a similar type of disaster. The Los Angeles Times viewed the flight number of 718 and its subsequent crash as a nod to co-creator J. J. Abrams' other series, Lost.The episode also had an influence on the series' fourth season, which featured parallel stories to those that occurred in earlier episodes. The season's sixteenth episode, ""Nothing As It Seems"", centers around the ""designer virus"" that had caused Marshall Bowman to transform, but this time he does so in the airport after his plane has safely landed. Peter recognizes the case from his own timeline, as seen in the events of ""The Transformation"", and helps the Fringe team locate Daniel Hicks."
209	"""The Transformation"" first aired on February 3, 2009 in the United States, and was watched by an estimated 12.78 million viewers. The episode earned a 5/6.5 ratings share among viewers aged 18–49, meaning that it was seen by 5.0 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6.5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. This rating meant it ranked eighth for the week among all the major networks. Sarah Stegall of SFScope attributed this ratings success to its lead-in show, the highly rated American Idol, and observed that ""with episodes like this one, mixing action, horror, and a few tender moments, it looks like Fringe is hitting its stride with viewers."""
210	"""The Transformation"" received generally positive reviews. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review, opining that it ""hit the perfect tone for Fringe [and had] the right mixture of science fiction, dark comedy, crime story and melodrama"". Hanson was, however, disappointed with the closure of the Olivia–John Scott storyline, as he hoped that ""she doesn't carry this torch too long"" because he preferred the ""flirty"" Olivia. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode 9.0/10, an indication of an ""amazing"" installment. He was pleased with the absence of Sanford Harris and enjoyed the ""brilliantly written and directed"" undercover sting operation, particularly because Peter was properly utilized as Olivia's ""wingman."" Isler also criticized the monster's special effects and believed there were still unanswered questions concerning Scott's storyline.Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray thought it was the best ""freak-meet"" of the series thus far, as well as one of its best episodes, which he would ""eagerly show to Fringe-doubters as evidence that the series has found its legs."" He consequently graded the episode an A−, further attributing the success of the episode to ""top-tier"" writers Orci and Whedon and ""skilled"" director Brad Anderson. Murray wrote, ""I wouldn't say that 'The Transformation' broke any new ground. If anything, it recapitulated pretty much every previous Fringe element—bio-weapons sales, telepathic communication, Massive Dynamics,  [sic] airplane crashes, etc.—but did so in a way that was energetic, tense, and even a little emotional."" SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall had difficulty ""suspend[ing her] disbelief"" with the science behind Bowman's rapid transformation. Though she thought it was ""sweet"" that Scott's proposal ""echo[ed] the real-life recent marriage between Anna Torv and Mark Valley,"" Stegall was pleased that the series could now move onto another storyline."

It was directed by Norberto Barba, his only contribution to the series. Jared Harris guest-starred as Jones, alongside actors Clark Middleton, Michael Gaston, Noah Bean, and Chance Kelly.
216	"It first aired in the United States on February 10, 2009, on the Fox network to an estimated 9.83 million viewers, placing second in its timeslot. The episode earned a 4.1/10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 4.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. ""Ability"" received mixed reviews from television critics."
217	"A newspaper vendor dies by suffocation after receiving a two-dollar bill coated in a chemical substance that causes all his orifices to close up. Walter analyzes the chemical agent and finds that the agent speeds up protein synthesis in scar tissue and accelerates cell growth.  Meanwhile, Olivia postulates that the initials ""ZFT"" may not be of a terrorist organization but of a book, and discovers the German name, ""Zerstörung durch Fortschritte der Technologie"", roughly ""Destruction by Advancement of Technology"". Peter takes Olivia to a rare book storekeeper, Edward Markham (Clark Middleton) who gets a copy of the ZFT book from another collector. Peter returns with it to Walter's lab, learning that it is a typewritten manifesto preparing ""soldiers"" for an upcoming war between two universes."
218	Concurrently, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) turns himself in at the FBI headquarters. Suffering from effects of being teleported out of his German prison cell by Walter's technology, he insists on only speaking to Olivia, warning that she is the only one that can stop a bomb from going off in 36 hours. Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) instead orders Olivia to join other agents in raiding a warehouse which they believe Jones and his men used. Evidence confirms Jones had been there, but an agent dies from suffocation after finding another two-dollar bill.
219	"Olivia convinces Harris to let her see Jones alone, attributing the agent's death to his misfire. In the interrogation room, Olivia discovers that Jones believes she is one of the soldiers in his war, having been a test subject on a Massive Dynamic nootropic drug known as ""Cortexiphan"" when she was a child. Jones claims that she is special, and instructs her to a remote site with a key in his possession to retrieve a package. Olivia follows his instructions, finding a package full of strange puzzles. The first puzzle is a light box containing a number of lights which Jones' instructions require her to disable with her thoughts only. Olivia, having learned from Nina Sharp that the only Cortexiphan trials were done in Ohio, far from her childhood Jacksonville, Florida home, is confident Jones is mistaken."
220	As Jones' condition worsens and he is brought to Walter's lab, Peter rigs the lightbox to make the lights go off automatically. Olivia performs the test in front of Jones, and he supplies her the address of the bomb.  When Olivia and the FBI arrive, they find that the bomb is set to release the deadly agent across the city but can only be defused if Olivia turns off a similar array of lights as were on the puzzle. Despite faking the earlier test, Olivia is successful at disabling the lights and the bomb with her thoughts.
221	In the episode's epilogue, Jones, having been transferred to secured hospital, is rescued by his men, leaving a message on the wall telling Olivia she passed. Meanwhile, Walter, who has also started reading the ZFT, recognizes a unique offset letter, and finds that his own lab typewriter produces the same offset. Olivia receives a call from Nina who had further looked into the Cortexiphan trials and discovered a smaller case study that occurred at Jacksonville.
222	"The episode's teleplay was written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman based on a story by executive story editors and scientists Glen Whitman and Robert Chiappetta. It was Goodman's fifth contribution to the series and Whitman and Chiappetta's first. The episode was directed by Norberto Barba, his only directional credit with the series.Noah Bean noted that his character Officer Kemp ""meets pretty gruesome, unbelievable ends,"" as Kemp's face becomes covered with skin and scar tissue. To create the effect of Kemp's orifices closing, the crew used a combination of make-up and computer graphic effects. They created casts of Bean, including the front of his face, ears, back, and torso. They applied make-up over parts of his face at different stages as the scene demanded. For Olivia's unsuccessful emergency tracheotomy, the actress cut into a fake neck that Bean wore.Guest actor Jared Harris made his third appearance of the season in ""Ability"". At the time, the actor had not heard whether his character would be returning, though he later appeared in the first-season finale and five fourth season episodes. Harris described his character as an ""anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause"" and the episode as ""a page-turner... When I read it, I said, 'Ah, this is a fantastic one. I can't wait to see it.' It's directed with a lot of energy, a lot of tension. It's a good one, a really good one"".The episode featured the first of many guest appearances by actor Clark Middleton as the rare bookseller Edward Markham. In addition to Bean and Harris, the episode's guest stars included Michael Gaston as Sanford Harris, Chance Kelly as Mitchell Loeb, Kenneth Tigar as Johan Lennox, Philip LeStrange as Thomas Avery, and Michael Cerveris as the Observer."
223	"""Ability"" was watched by an estimated 9.83 million viewers on its initial broadcast in the United States, placing in second in its timeslot behind CBS' The Mentalist. Fringe was the Fox network's fourth most watched show for the week, and received a 5.9/9 rating share among all American households. Among adults aged 18 to 49, the episode finished in fourteenth place for the week by earning a 4.1/10 ratings share, meaning that it was seen by 4.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast."
224	"Den of Geek viewed the episode positively, observing that in contrast to the previous installment, ""Ability"" ""progresses the main plot arc in a substantial way... I’m now really interested to see what happens next, whereas last week I wasn’t that bothered."" IGN's Ramsey Isler was a little more critical and rated the episode 7.8/10. He noted that though the ending with Walter ""was as good as you could ask for"" and enjoyed David Robert Jones as a villain, the episode had a ""number of rough patches,"" as the middle was ""paced slowly"" and lacking in suspense, Peter's ""handiness was again reduced to ...'that guy with connections'"", and the audience was ""once again subjected to the torture that is Sanford Harris"". After describing the Olivia-Peter scene near the end as ""tense and cleverly written,"" Isler concluded his review by noting references to The X-Files and hoping Jones would appear again soon.Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining he thought it must have been ""satisfying"" for those viewers tired of the ""monster-of-the-week"" storylines. Murray also enjoyed two twists: that Olivia had to shut off the lights for real, and that Walter discovers he wrote the ZFT manual at the end. Jane Boursaw of AOL TV (previously TV Squad) opined that it was a ""really great episode that's probably worth another viewing to pick up more clues,"" while the Los Angeles Times' Andrew Hanson thought it ""managed to have a couple good twists to it."" Annalee Newitz of io9 praised ""Ability"", remarking that ""overall, this was a terrific episode, and a great way to go into a show hiatus. We got a lot of payoff when we discovered why Olivia was being stalked by the ZFT weirdos, and we learned more about the Pattern than we had in a really long time."""

228	"""Inner Child""  is the 15th episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe, and the fifteenth  episode overall. The episode was written by co-producer Brad Caleb Kane and staff writer Julia Cho and directed by filmmaker Frederick E. O. Toye. It first aired in the United States on April 7, 2009 on the Fox Broadcasting Company."
229	The episode relates the intersecting stories of a subterranean feral child looked after by Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and the return of a serial killer from her time before joining the Fringe Division.
230	A demolition team is about to bring down a building when one worker is drawn to an area not marked on the blueprints. Inside the area they find a path to the building's foundation, and in the darkness, a boy (Spencer List). The boy is taken to a children's hospital and the Fringe division is contacted. The construction workers examined where the boy was found and determined it had been sealed off for seventy years and could not determine how the boy got inside. The boy does not speak, and Walter Bishop (John Noble) explains some of his medical conditions as a result of living underground for several years. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) seems to be the only person that the boy reacts to, and she helps to coax him to help in his treatment. At one point, she encourages him to eat by sharing candy with him, but he only places the yellow pieces in the form of an arrow for her.
231	"Meanwhile, Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) receives a fax, which he recognizes as a taunting invitation from the serial killer the Artist (Jeremy Shamos), who kills women and ""displays"" them in gruesome poses.  Charlie contacts Olivia at the hospital requesting her help, but as she takes notes, the boy attempts to take her writing tools. Olivia gives them to the boy, and he writes, upside down, a name. Olivia and Charlie, along with other agents, later find the body of the Artist's latest victim, who has the same name that the boy wrote down earlier. Later, the boy provides an address, and  Olivia and Charlie race to the location, but this time find nothing. Only later do they learn that a second victim was taken from that spot moments before they arrived. Walter comes to believe the boy has an empathic connection to the case."
232	Walter seeks to use a neural stimulator to understand the boy's empathy, but Peter only allows it after Walter devises less invasive methods. Though the child's mind is difficult to understand, they obtain a third location. Olivia, Charlie, and other agents set up a roadblock in the area and check all vehicles going through it. Olivia spies a van with a yellow tree-shaped air freshener, and recalling the child's candy display from earlier, determines that the Artist is inside. The killer attempts to escape, and Olivia stabs him to death with his own knife during the struggle.
233	Olivia and Broyles arrange the transfer of the child to an adopting family, in large part to keep him away from Eliot Michaels (Erik Palladino), an alleged “social worker” who wants to claim him for CIA research.  While in transit to his new home, the boy makes eye contact with the Observer, September (Michael Cerveris), with whom he shares a resemblance.
234	The episode was written by co-producer Brad Caleb Kane and staff writer Julia Cho and directed by filmmaker Frederick E. O. Toye. It was Kane and Cho's third contributions to the series and Toye's fourth.Ari Graynor and Lily Pilblad guest starred as Rachel Dunham and her daughter Ella. The episode also featured guest stars Spencer List as the Child, Jeremy Shamos as the Artist, Erik Palladino as Eliot Michaels, Victor Williams as Phil, Alicia Goranson as Samantha Gilmore, Matt Mulhern as Dennis, Sandra Daley as Dr. Winick, Jimmy Palumbo as Mike, and Phil Nee as Archie.
235	Peter shows the feral boy an action figure of the G.I. Joe character Roadblock, and comments that he always remembers the character as having a scar on the other side of his face. This may be an early indication of differences that Peter remembers from his childhood in the parallel universe.
236	"""Inner Child"" was the first episode to air after a two-month hiatus. It was delayed by about 30 minutes because American Idol ran long for the night. The episode won its ad-hoc 9:30–10:30 Eastern timeslot, with about 9.6 million live viewers and a 9 share among viewers 18–49. Fringe also helped Fox win the night in total number of viewers. When asked by a reporter if he was ""infuriated"" with Fox because of the Idol-induced delay, co-creator J. J. Abrams replied ""I will say that I have a different opinion about the network, but I, too, have heard from a number of people [about the issue]. It is infuriating""."
237	"Jo Garfein at TV Overmind gave the episode a positive preview, saying, ""This episode has more of an early X-Files feel, in a good way...  To those of you who have either given up on the series or are on the fence, I recommend that you give Fringe another try. If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we are in for a very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season."" Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, ""As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later."" Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, ""My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'"" Apparently, they're keeping track of these creatures or Observers. And if so, where are the others?""Noel Murray at The Onion's The A. V. Club gave the episode qualified approval with a B rating.  According to Murray, ""The serial killer stuff in 'Inner Child was fairly pat—with elements swiped wholesale from Thomas Harris and Michael Connelly—and the 'keep Lil’ O away from Eliot' operation struck me as a little sloppy, if not actively implausible. But the episode was fast-paced and creepy, with a few good Walter lines (my favorite being a tie between 'Agent Dunham knows what a penis looks like' and 'obviously I was sitting on the toilet') and the return of his wonderfully ridiculous mad scientist device, 'the neural stimulator.'"""

241	"""Unleashed"" is the 16th episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. It centered on a man-made chimera, which escaped from an animal testing facility and attacked various people, including Agent Charlie Francis, while the Fringe team tries to stop it."
242	The episode was written by Zack Whedon and J. R. Orci, and directed by Brad Anderson. Actress Kiersten Warren guest-starred as Charlie's wife Sonia.
243	"It first aired in the United States on the Fox Broadcasting Network on April 14, 2009, and more than 10 million viewers watched the episode. It received mixed reviews, with a common criticism being that the ""monster-of-the-week"" was becoming a tired idea for the show."
244	Animal rights activists ransack a laboratory and unwittingly release a creature with a ferocious appetite. As they flee in an SUV, the creature follows and grotesquely mutilates them. The Fringe team consisting of FBI agents Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), Philip Broyles (Lance Reddick), and civilian consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrives, and Walter sees evidence of different creatures' marks on the bodies. Olivia realizes one of them is missing, and after interviewing a student at MIT to try to identify the victims, she realizes they were animal rights activists. While conducting autopsies on the bodies, an animal control team at a different site is killed by the creature after investigating a call.
245	While investigating the animal control team deaths, Charlie is attacked by the creature, but it fails to kill him after Olivia arrives on the scene. Walter explains he believes the creature is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes that someone else must have taken up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, and that he has less than 24 hours to live.
246	After experimenting with poison fails to kill the larvae in Charlie's body, Walter believes that mixing the chimera's blood with Charlie's will stop the larvae from attacking and bursting out of his body, as they did in the other victims' corpses. Olivia learns one of the victims, Jonathan Swift, was the son of a scientist who tests on animals, and was killed while breaking into his father's lab. They also realize the chimera was created based on work by one of Walter's peers, not Walter himself.
247	After several sightings, the Fringe team move into some nearby storm drains to bait the chimera with its larvae. Feeling somewhat responsible, Walter locks himself in with the chimera and ingests some poison that will kill him within the hour, believing that if it kills him, the chimera will only be killing itself. He manages to shoot the chimera in time, however, and they use its blood to find a cure for Charlie.
248	"""Unleashed"" was directed by filmmaker Brad Anderson, his third episode of the season. It was co-written by writer Zack Whedon and supervising producer J. R. Orci.The episode centered on Kirk Acevedo's character Charlie Francis. Acevedo explained in an interview, ""Charlie goes out on this call, and he gets attacked by this mythological, genetically enhanced griffin. He fights for his life throughout the episode"". Acevedo suggested that his wife, actress Kiersten Warren, play his character's wife Sonia, and the producers duly cast her. Acevedo explained his choice was because, ""to create intimacy with someone who you don't know is actually not going to work. So to have your real wife do it, then you can be a lot better on screen"".The scene where Walter confronts the chimera was shot in a Boston sewer. He and Peter carry 50 caliber Desert Eagle handguns, called ""monster killers"" by one prop crew member. While shooting, the actors had to use their imagination, as the CGI monster was not yet complete. Director Brad Anderson described the chimera ""sort of an amalgam of a bat, lion, and a dragon"". Anderson called the scene between Walter and the chimera as a ""triumphant moment"" for Walter, and actor Joshua Jackson characterized the scene as Walter's ""action hero moment"". The actor himself, John Noble, described the scene with the chimera as ""terrifying"", as his character ""tries to be a hero"". Andrew Orloff, Zoic’s Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor later called the chimera effect the most difficult effect he'd done for the show thus far. Sound editor Thomas Harris explained that because the episode had a monster that was ""part lizard, part wasp, part bat, and part lion,"" it was difficult to ""manipulate sounds from all these animals, as well as other sweeteners, without getting muddy and meshing together"". Their efforts on the episode were ultimately nominated in several categories at the Golden Reel Awards, and at the HPA Awards, for which they won.Actress Jasika Nicole explained in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her at the time was ""Unleashed"". She described the episode's production, ""The props people had these big buckets of earth worms, but they were thicker and meatier and longer. They had teeny little bitty faces... So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours to make it look like he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead."" Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot ""three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [for him]. It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun. The guy was such a trooper.""New Media consultant Glen Whitman stated in an interview that this particular episode contains some recent scientific developments that were part of their inspiration for the creation of Fringe in the first place. Specifically, Whitman is referring to the use of transgenics, which is the idea that there are organisms with genes from other species. Whitman concluded that they were partly inspired by scientists Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y. Tsien and their work on research on isolating genes from jellyfish for the treatment of Huntington's disease; all three won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry."
249	"""Unleashed"" was watched by more than 10.15 million viewers in the United States. It had a 5.9/9 share among all households."
250	"Ramsey Isler from IGN rated it 7.8/10, explaining the ""mysterious escaped monster"" is a tired idea that failed to bring anything new to the show, and the episode ""lacked real suspense and intrigue"". Isler however praised the further development of John Noble's character, as Walter took responsibility for his actions. Josie Kafka of Open Salon.com saw allusions in the episode to many other genres, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Halloween, and Dollhouse. She thought the ""Walter-Peter interchanges"" were the most interesting aspects of the episode. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded the episode a B-, writing that though he enjoyed the ""thrilling, funny opening"" and the ""multiple amusing lines of dialogue,"" he wished the episode had gone further with the genetic experimentation concept. Murray concluded that ""'Unleashed' stays at the level of a well-shot, disappointingly straightforward monster movie, with an everything’s-okay-now ending"".Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the chimera premise, but wrote she was willing to overlook that because the episode ""delivers [entertainment] in spades"" and gives ""a fine payoff... There are creepy sewers, pee jokes, heroics, tears, laughter, scares, and finally a kill shot of a terrifically scary monster"". Stegall also praised Torv and Acevedo's performances, and called the episode the best she's watched in a while. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times praised the episode, writing the writers and characters were ""finally getting into their groove,"" and that the monster sequence was ""better than most horror films I’ve seen lately""."
251	"""Unleashed"" was nominated for several awards. At the 2009 HPA Awards, the episode and its crew were nominated and ultimately won for Outstanding Audio Post — Television. Its competition was an episode of Lost and an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. At the 2010 Golden Reel Awards, the episode was nominated for two categories: Best Sound Editing: Short Form Dialogue and ADR in Television and Best Sound Editing: Short Form Sound Effects and Foley in Television. It lost in the first category to an episode of True Blood, and the second category award went to an episode of House."

254	"""Bad Dreams"" is the 17th episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. It was written and directed by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, his first writing credit for a television show. In the episode, Olivia dreams she is causing people to either kill others or themselves, which leads her to meet Nick Lane, a man from her past that leads Olivia to discover their shared history as test subjects in a series of childhood drug trials."
255	The episode first aired on April 21, 2009, in the United States on Fox to more than 9.89 million viewers. It received generally positive reviews, with many critics praising the beginning dream sequence, the climax atop the building, and the final scene with Walter and the old footage of Olivia. Critics also enjoyed the further revelations about Olivia's background; the subject would later have an entire episode devoted to it in the third season.
256	Olivia (Anna Torv) dreams that she pushes a woman in front of a subway train at Grand Central Terminal, but assumes it was just in her head. In the morning however, the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train. Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream. Olivia is unconvinced, and goes with the Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon floating and begins to believe her, as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.
257	Olivia worries it will happen again, and though she attempts to ward off sleep, she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant. They interview the wife, who tells them she became so convinced her husband was going to leave her that she became angry and stabbed him. The team posits that while no one is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.
258	"Walter tells Olivia that she may have been in the same drug trials as Lane, and that the bond they share stems from Walter and William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) pairing up the children in the ""buddy system"". To find Lane, Walter uses this bond, putting Olivia under the effect of drugs so she experiences Lane's emotions. She sees Lane sleep with a stripper, who then is influenced to kill herself in a mirror of Lane's depressed thoughts; afterwards, Olivia discovers where Lane lives. While they explore his apartment, a suicidal Lane walks down a sidewalk, influencing others to mirror his emotions, so that they follow him to the top of a building. Because of her past in the trials, Walter believes Olivia won't be influenced by these suicidal thoughts, and she goes to encounter Lane alone. While Olivia does not remember him, he remembers her and the nickname he gave her: ""Olive."" Olivia wounds him, breaking his mind-control over the others, and he is placed in a medically-induced longterm coma to control his emotions."
259	The episode ends with Walter watching a video of Olivia as a child, apparently taken while she was being administered Cortexiphan. Walter's voice is heard on the tape, as is William Bell's. Both are trying to calm little Olivia while she sits, huddled amidst a debris-strewn room of equipment. It becomes clear Olivia has caused this chaos in Walter and Bell's lab, presumably with her Cortexiphan-induced abilities.
260	"The episode was written and directed by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman. Goldsman was ""attracted"" to the series because he believed that at the time, Fringe's ""mythology was already really starting to hum"". ""Bad Dreams"" was his first writing credit for a television episode, and he wrote several hours of material before co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner helped him condense it. Every episode since ""Bad Dreams"", Goldsman has been credited as a consulting producer. It marked the first episode with previous Fringe director Brad Anderson now also credited as a producer."
261	"The opening scene in the subway was initially going to be on top of a building so that the episode would begin and end the same, but co-creator J. J. Abrams thought it would be better to start it underground and ""move up throughout the episode"". The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a ""sense of unease"". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the ""hardest set to shoot at on the planet"" because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving back and forth on the 59th Street Bridge.The climactic scene where Olivia encounters Nick and the group of people at the top of the building was shot at 902 Broadway in Manhattan. Though the actors appeared to be on the edge of a very tall building, there was in fact a hidden roof extending out that they would have fallen on instead. The visual and special effects departments worked in conjunction to simulate the woman jumping off the building. While the actress simply jumped onto a tarp several feet below her, the crew rigged the car with pneumatic rams, air cannons, and cables to implode under the ""weight"" of her body, and then CGI was used to make the woman appear to fall on the car.Actress Anna Torv called the episode's hotel scene her favorite of the show so far, explaining ""I loved shooting that because it was the first time that Olivia really inched her way into that dynamic of Peter and Walter. She’s been kind of on the outside, and wrangling them constantly, but this gave me a glimpse into realizing everything is a little bit entwined, and building more of that emotional conflict between them. I really loved shooting that.""The final scene of the episode ended with a tape of a young Olivia in a fire-damaged room, leading to rumors her character was a fire starter. Torv however discounted this soon after, explaining ""I think it's more than that... I think what they got given or what they got taught is much bigger than just starting fire"". Jeff Pinkner agreed and elaborated further, ""We saw the consequence. We saw that she started a fire at the end of the last episode, but I think it's a mistake to assume that that's her power. I think the truth is, it's probably a consequence of her ability"". This particular scene, as well as the episode's reference to experiments Walter performed on children, comprise the main plot of the season three episode ""Subject 13""."
262	The episode was watched by more than 9.89 million viewers in the United States, with a 5.9/9 rating among all households.
263	"Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode with an A-; he praised the ""fine job"" of director/writer Akiva Goldsman, and thought the climax was ""extraordinarily well-shot and performed"". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, writing that it ""is a classic example of a story you have to be patient with. This was an episode with a compelling, shocking start that kept us hooked well enough to deal with some slow points in the rest of the first half-hour. But we were rewarded for our patience with one heck of a climax and epilogue. This was well-executed TV"". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought that while the first half wasn't very exciting, the second half had ""plenty to keep up interest"" as more was revealed about Olivia and Walter's backgrounds.Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com liked the scenes depicting Olivia and Broyles' relationship, as well as the revelations behind the experimentation on a young Olivia, and thought the Fox promos made the episode look much lamer than it actually was. io9's Annalee Newitz loved the ""great, creepy"" opening scene, the arc concerning Walter's past experimentation on children, and the ""well-played, funny and strange"" scene when ""Olivia"" goes to the strip club. Though a bit disappointed with the ""conspiracy"" story, Sfscope.com's Sarah Stegall nevertheless called the episode ""well-crafted,"" enjoyed the Peter-Olivia moments, praised Torv's performance, and said Akiva Goldsman ""gave us an episode built like a slow fuse: tightly wound, coiling out of sight, and finishing big."
264	Director-writer Akiva Goldsman submitted the episode for consideration in the Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series category at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, but did not receive a nomination.

In the episode, Fringe Division apprehend a scientist with ties to the terrorist group ZFT, who will hand them everything he knows on ZFT, in exchange for helping his wife, who was infected with a contagion that makes her kill people for their spinal fluid."
268	The episode first aired on April 28, 2009 in the United States on the Fox Broadcasting Company, and was seen by 9.623 million viewers. Critical reactions towards the episode were mixed; reviewers criticized the episode for having a typical plot, but enjoyed some of the background stories.
269	Fringe Division investigate the murder of Bob Dunn (Richard Short) in his apartment. He is found with a severed spinal column, and his spinal fluid drained out. While autopsying the body, Walter Bishop (John Noble) finds human teeth marks, and that the killer's saliva contains traces of an extinct strain of syphilis. The team discover that a lab sample of the strain was sold to Lubov Pharmaceutical, which also bought other samples of bacteria. Lubov has ties with ZFT. The investigation leads to the address of Nicholas Boone (Jefferson Mays), the head of the company. Boone admits he works for the bioterrorist group ZFT, and will give them everything he knows on the organization if they save his wife Valerie (Trieste Dunn) from them. After leading Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) to a restaurant, a ZFT hideout, she finds no sign of her, and Boone admits that Valerie is the killer they are looking for; ZFT infected her with a contagion when Boone initially refused to cooperate. The contagion burns spinal fluid faster than her body can replace it. In a vain effort to work on a cure several weeks previous, Boone used some of his own spinal fluid, costing him the use of his legs. Over the course of the episode, two more male bodies are discovered, having died in a similar manner.
270	Boone is allowed to work with Walter in his laboratory to work on the cure, later finding out they have to make an augmented form of penicillin; the first trial is unsuccessful. Boone realizes that more spinal fluid is needed to complete the process, and sacrifices more of his. Walter realizes that Boone tricked him and asks him why and Boone responds rhetorically about what one is willing to do for those that they love, which seems to strike a chord with Walter. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) finds a link between the three victims; they all visited the same nightclub. Olivia and Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) enter the club and manage to find Valerie, with the help of a thermal imaging camera, as her infection causes her to have a raised body heat, and subdue her with tranquilizer guns. They return to the lab where Valerie is successfully cured, but Boone dies from the loss of spinal fluid. However, beforehand, Boone managed to have pre-recorded a message for Olivia, informing her that ZFT has been funded by Massive Dynamic founder William Bell.
271	In the meantime, Olivia's sister Rachel (Ari Graynor) learns that her husband is divorcing her, and demands full custody of daughter Ella, claiming that Rachel is an unfit parent. In response, Olivia asks superior Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) for the telephone number of his divorce lawyer.
272	"""Midnight"" first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 28, 2009. It was watched by 9.623 million viewers, Fox's fifth highest rated show for the week, and a household rating of 5.6/8. It also earned a 4.0 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, representing 5.215 million out of the total viewers, and was the ninth largest audience on American television in that demographic the week it aired. The lead-in from American Idol helped Fringe win its timeslot, and helped Fox win the night in the 18-49 demographic."
273	"Critical reactions of the episode were generally mixed. Annalee Newitz of io9 was positive towards the episode, opining ""last night's Fringe made us feel all grody-happy inside,"" and it is ""scoring well on the tightly-plotted-o-meter."" Newitz also thought the ZFT conspiracy plotline in the episode was ""an easy conspiracy to follow."" Ramsey Isler of IGN rated the episode 7.5/10, having enjoyed the interactions between Peter and Walter, and of Olivia and Broyles with divorce, noting ""just how creepily observant both of these characters are. It was a clever addition to the relationship between those two, and it was nice to see Broyles in a casual environment at the end of the show."" However Isler felt the plot was ""kind of boring"", and ""was more like a series of ""good"" moments sprinkled throughout a fairly mediocre storyline. This episode deserves some recognition for showing us new aspects of these characters we've grown to care about, but overall, the story just lacked the normal punch of a Fringe episode.""Los Angeles Times reviewer Andrew Hanson felt disappointed with the outcome of the episode; ""Nicholas (and the writers who wrote him) teased of big answers to the questions surrounding ZFT but ends up giving up only one name,"" though he added; ""Granted, it's a pretty big name: William Bell."" Sarah Stegall of SFScope thought the writers ""gave us some moments of real poignancy,"" but was disappointed of Olivia's characterization, stating ""they need to study that character more closely,"" and that she ""deserves more respect than this."" Furthermore, Stegall had a problem with ""the constant revelation of secrets we should have known about, secrets that should be game changers but later get relegated to background filler."" Of the plot, the reviewer thought it was ""A middling episode, but still much better than the early days of the series."" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B, stating that although it looked like it was ""going to be even more of a freak-of-the-week outing this usual,"" by the midpoint it became ""deeply tied into the show’s larger mythology,"" but criticised the lack of tie-ins. Furthermore it ""kept fumbling towards different themes without every really completing any one thought, and had the episode explored any of the ideas more fully, I’d have probably been more into it."" Television Without Pity meanwhile, graded the episode with a B."
